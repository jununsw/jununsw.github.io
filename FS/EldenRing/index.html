                </div> 
                <div class="col-sm-8"> 
                    <p>Upon entering the Realm of Shadow, you will see a faint light glowing before you. Walk towards this and follow the steps leading to a view of the vast land you are now in. Activate the Gravesite Plain - Site of Grace ahead and interact with it so you have a checkpoint here. Walk northeast past the Site of Grace and look for the dirt path. Follow this path leading north and pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Map: Gravesite Plain" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Map:+Gravesite+Plain" target="">Map: Gravesite Plain</a> in the stele to your right, like the one in the base game. This unlocks the Gravesite Plain on your map and will help you navigate more easily.</p> 
                    <p>While in this area, be on the lookout for a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Curseblade" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Curseblade" target="">Curseblade</a>, this is an enemy with two blades that will attack you. After defeating it, head south this time and follow the dirt path. You can summon Torrent here so you can cover more distance. You can also pick up items along the way to help with crafting like <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Redflesh Mushroom" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Redflesh+Mushroom" target="">Redflesh Mushroom</a>, <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Whiteflesh Mushroom" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Whiteflesh+Mushroom" target="">Whiteflesh Mushroom</a>, and <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Rada Fruit" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rada+Fruit" target="">Rada Fruit</a> on the ground. You will also encounter shadow enemies here that can attack you while riding your mount. Stay on this dirt path and continue up until you see the thick woods to the south.</p> 
                    <p>Stray from the dirt path for a bit and go into the woods. Listen and follow the bird sounds while in this area. You will come across a hostile NPC called <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Logur the Beast Claw" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Logur+the+Beast+Claw" target="">Logur the Beast Claw</a> in the middle of the woods. This NPC drops the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Beast Claw (Weapon)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Beast+Claw+(Weapon)" target="">Beast Claw (Weapon)</a> upon defeating it.</p> 
                    <p>Return to the dirt path and continue until you see a broken cart and dead bodies. Take a moment here to pick up the following items: <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Glass Shard" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Glass+Shard" target="">Glass Shard</a>, <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Black Pyrefly" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Black+Pyrefly" target="">Black Pyrefly</a>, and x10 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Arrow" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Arrow" target="">Arrow</a>. Then, continue following the dirt path until you reach the area outside the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Church of Consolation" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Church+of+Consolation" target="">Church of Consolation</a>. You can pick up <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Dewgem" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dewgem" target="">Dewgem</a> on top of the stones surrounding the church and in the area close to the nearby waterfall. You can follow the cliff wall going north, in which you will find a corpse containing a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Blessing of Marika" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Blessing+of+Marika" target="">Blessing of Marika</a> surrounded by Messmer Soldiers. Go back to the church, and you will find a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Black Pyrefly" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Black+Pyrefly" target="">Black Pyrefly</a> behind it.</p> 
                    <p><a id="Consolation"></a>Inside the church, you will find a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Black Knight" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Black+Knight" target="">Black Knight</a> patrolling the aisle. It's up to you if you want to kill it or you can go around the church, stay crouched, and sneak in front of the altar to pick up x2 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Scadutree Fragment" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scadutree+Fragment" target="">Scadutree Fragment</a>. However, if you opt to defeat the enemy, you can obtain <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Black Steel Greathammer" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Black+Steel+Greathammer" target="">Black Steel Greathammer</a>, <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Black Knight Helm" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Black+Knight+Helm" target="">Black Knight Helm</a>, and <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithing Stone" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone" target="">Smithing Stone [6]</a> as a reward. Then, take the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Scadutree Fragment" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scadutree+Fragment" target="">Scadutree Fragment</a> in front of the altar. You can use this to level up your Scadutree Blessing while resting on a Site of Grace. Outside the church, there's a small camp of Messmer Soldiers to the east. You can eliminate these soldiers for a chance to loot a piece of their armor and then go inside the round tent to pick up x2 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Fire Coil" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fire+Coil" target="">Fire Coil</a> from a corpse. This is your last stop in the southern area.</p> 
                    <p>Return to the dirt path and head north this time. Stay close to the right side where you can pick up a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Larval Tear" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Larval+Tear" target="">Larval Tear</a> at the edge of the cliff here. [<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Interactive Map?id=248658&amp;code=mapD" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=248658&amp;code=mapD">See Shadow of the Erdtree Map</a>]. This item can only be picked up at night and can be found in the center of a small illuminated gravesite.</p> 
                    <p>When you're done here, scale the edge and proceed to the northeastern cliff where you see the waterfall. Go to the small altar and pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Revered Spirit Ash" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Revered+Spirit+Ash" target="">Revered Spirit Ash</a>, this is also a new item that lets you boost <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Spirit Ashes" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Spirit+Ashes" target="">Spirit Ashes</a> beyond +10 and increase the durability and damage dealt by <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Torrent" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Torrent" target="">Torrent</a> within the realm of shadow. From the small altar, continue exploring Gravesite Plain by sticking to the edge of the map. You will come across a small gravesite area with <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow Undead" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+Undead" target="">Shadow Undead</a> enemies. Make sure to eliminate the glimmering <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadowpot" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadowpot" target="">Shadowpot</a> to get the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Scadutree Fragment" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scadutree+Fragment" target="">Scadutree Fragment</a> drop [<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Interactive Map?id=659046&amp;code=mapD" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=659046&amp;code=mapD">See it on the SOTE Map</a>] and other crafting materials. You can also pick up a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Spiritgrave Stone" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Spiritgrave+Stone" target="">Spiritgrave Stone</a> from one of the stone heads and x3 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Black Pyrefly" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Black+Pyrefly" target="">Black Pyrefly</a> on the ground.</p> 
                    <p>After that, head west to reach <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Scorched Ruins" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scorched+Ruins" target="">Scorched Ruins</a>. This is a small area where you can fight some enemies and pick up important items and the first thing you will do is to activate the Site of Grace found north of the building. If you have been following this Walkthrough, take the time to use the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Revered Spirit Ash" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Revered+Spirit+Ash" target="">Revered Spirit Ash</a> and <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Scadutree Fragment" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scadutree+Fragment" target="">Scadutree Fragment</a> you collected while resting on the Site of Grace. </p> 
                    <p>From the Scorched Ruins - Site of Grace, walk beneath the building and go over to the southern side. Turn around and climb the stairs to your left, and take the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Hefty Cracked Pot" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Hefty+Cracked+Pot" target="">Hefty Cracked Pot</a> from the corpse. This is a material that can be used for crafting cracked pot items. You can also loot other crafting items on the ground here. Continue to your right and take the stairs to the destroyed room. Then, pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Greater Potentate's Cookbook (1)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Greater+Potentate's+Cookbook+(1)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Greater Potentate's Cookbook [1]</a> from a corpse on the stairs here. Next, go inside the broken building and look for the corpse hidden within jars by destroying it. You can pick up the Shadow Realm Rune here. Go to the second floor and walk towards the enemies attacking you from the opposite building. Cross the roof to the other side and pick up <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Black Pyrefly" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Black+Pyrefly" target="">Black Pyrefly</a> behind this room. Then, go back to the front of this room and open the door to reveal a chest containing the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Blade of Mercy" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Blade+of+Mercy" target="">Blade of Mercy</a> (Talisman). After that, drop down to the balcony below it. Jump to the next platform and pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Bone Dart" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bone+Dart" target="">Bone Dart</a> from a corpse. This is the quick coverage of Scorched Ruins.</p> 
                    <p>The next location is an optional dungeon where you can fight a boss for a reward. Head west where you see white withered trees in the distance. As you get near a tall gravestone, 2 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Gravebird" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Gravebird">Gravebirds</a> will swoop down to attack you. Continue traveling west and go past the glowing <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Blue Worm" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Blue+Worm" target="">Blue Worm</a> creatures. Continue riding Torrent until you reach the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Western Nameless Mausoleum" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Western+Nameless+Mausoleum" target="">Western Nameless Mausoleum</a>. You can go inside this building to defeat the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Blackgaol Knight" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Blackgaol+Knight" target="">Blackgaol Knight</a> and earn the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Greatsword of Solitude" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Greatsword+of+Solitude" target="">Greatsword of Solitude</a> and <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Solitude Set" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Solitude+Set" target="">Solitude Set</a> as a reward.</p> 
                    <p><a id="TheSacredTower"></a>After fighting the Blackgaol Knight, return to Scorched Ruins - Site of Grace and then continue exploring the northeastern side by scaling the edge of the plain. Keep an eye out for a cave here with a glowing light. Go inside the cave and interact with <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring The Sacred Tower Painting" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/The+Sacred+Tower+Painting" target="">The Sacred Tower Painting</a>. [<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Interactive Map?id=655558&amp;code=mapD" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=655558&amp;code=mapD">See the location on Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree Map</a>]. As you head back outside, you will come across Inquisitor enemies who use Fire and Magic. Go toward the small altar with 4 pillars located behind this pack of enemies to pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Backhand Blade" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Backhand+Blade" target="">Backhand Blade</a>. Continue along the cliff and take the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Grave Gloveworts" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Grave+Gloveworts">Grave Glovewort</a> from the corpse on the stone. You might come across a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Gravebird" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Gravebird" target="">Gravebird</a> here again.</p> 
                    <p><a id="FurnaceGolem"></a>Back to the dirt path along Scorched Ruins, you will encounter the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Furnace Golem" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Furnace+Golem" target="">Furnace Golem</a>, an elite enemy that drops runes, <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Deflecting Hardtear" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Deflecting+Hardtear" target="">Deflecting Hardtear</a>, and <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Furnace Visage" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Furnace+Visage" target="">Furnace Visage</a> upon death. You will also see more of this enemy in other locations, but each of them has a unique tear drop. This enemy will also start throwing projectiles at you if you get too close.</p> 
                    <ul> 
                    <li>The Furnace Golem can be tough to beat because of the wide AoE attacks that it can do. It will take some time to get used to but the movement is slow and can be dodged by timing it with a jump before its foot hits the ground. If you're having a hard time, you can ride <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Torrent" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Torrent" target="">Torrent</a> while fighting this boss and then focus on attacking the legs. You can take advantage of Torrent's double jump so you can have more air time.</li> 
                    </ul> 
                    <p>Proceed north by tracing the dirt path and stop where you see a trace of light glowing from the ground, and some figures are gathered near it. Head towards them and make sure to activate the Three-Path Cross Site of Grace here. Talk to the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring NPCs" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/NPCs" target="">NPCs</a>, who you will come to know as followers of Miquella. Just like Needle Knight Leda said, these followers will offer help in your journey in tracing Miquella's footsteps. You can pick up an <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Empyrean-Blood Burgeon" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Empyrean-Blood+Burgeon" target="">Empyrean-Blood Burgeon</a> and a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Scadutree Fragment" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scadutree+Fragment" target="">Scadutree Fragment</a> on the ground next to the cross. Interact with the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring NPCs" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/NPCs" target="">NPCs</a> here and make sure to exhaust the dialogues of <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Hornsent" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Hornsent" target="">Hornsent</a> to receive the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Cross Map" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Cross+Map" target="">Cross Map</a> from him. The other NPC is <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Redmane Freyja" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Redmane+Freyja" target="">Redmane Freyja</a> who you can speak with to get more info about <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Hornsent" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Hornsent" target="">Hornsent</a>. Exhaust her dialogues before you continue exploring the northernmost area.</p> 
                    <p><a id="NorthGreatbridge"></a>From the Three-Path Cross Site of Grace, head to the area below the greatbridge. Look for a path on the left side and carefully jump down. Stick to the wall and take the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ash of War: Savage Lion's Claw" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ash+of+War:+Savage+Lion's+Claw" target="">Ash of War: Savage Lion's Claw</a> from a small camp here. Then, face the east direction toward the bridge to find a way to the lower area here. While going down, at night, you can see the blue glow of a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Larval Tear" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Larval+Tear">Larval Tear</a>.

When you're done here, you can travel north to reach your next destination, which is the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Abandoned Ailing Village" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Abandoned+Ailing+Village" target="">Abandoned Ailing Village</a>.</p> 
                    <p>To reach Abandoned Ailing Village, stick to the edge of the cliff here and travel north. Continue until you reach a dead-end where you will find a small altar with the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Revered Spirit Ash" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Revered+Spirit+Ash" target="">Revered Spirit Ash</a>. Eliminate the nearby giant moths so you can safely take this item. Then, circle back and go to the ramp so you can activate the Greatbridge, North - Site of Grace. </p> 
                    <p>You will see a ghost facedown on the ground ahead of you. Interact with it before you proceed to Abandoned Ailing Village. Go to the edge of the cliff behind the ghost and pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Human Bone Shard" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Human+Bone+Shard" target="">Human Bone Shard</a> from a corpse. Continue walking at the edge and you will find another corpse on the wooden platform where you can obtain the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ailment Talisman" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ailment+Talisman" target="">Ailment Talisman</a>. Before leaving this area, go to the other side of the houses (across the ghost) and you will find a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Broken Rune" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Broken+Rune" target="">Broken Rune</a> from a corpse. </p> 
                    <p>You can now travel west toward the lake and you will see a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ghostflame Dragon" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ghostflame+Dragon" target="">Ghostflame Dragon</a> in the distance. There's a summoning pool that you can activate if you want to use it. Defeating this boss will reward you with x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Dragon Heart" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dragon+Heart" target="">Dragon Heart</a> and x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Somber Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Ancient+Dragon+Smithing+Stone" target="">Somber Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone</a>. See the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ghostflame Dragon" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ghostflame+Dragon" target="">Ghostflame Dragon</a> for information and strategies to defeating this boss. You can also pick up a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Great Katana" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Great+Katana" target="">Great Katana</a> from a corpse next to the dragon. After this fight, continue exploring north where you will find a small shack below the Abandoned Ailing Village. There's a corpse outside at roof level where you can pick up <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Fly Mold" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fly+Mold" target="">Fly Mold</a>, then, you can jump on top of the house and drop down through the hole in the roof to pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Greater Potentate's Cookbook (10)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Greater+Potentate's+Cookbook+(10)">Greater Potentate's Cookbook [10]</a>.</p> 
                    <p>Next, head west into an area in Gravebird statues. You can pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Gravebird Armor" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Gravebird+Armor" target="">Gravebird Armor</a> from the altar in the middle here. Then, follow the body of water leading to metal barricades scattered on the ground. This will lead to an entrance to <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Belurat Gaol" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Belurat+Gaol" target="">Belurat Gaol</a> where you can defeat an optional boss called <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Demi-Human Swordmaster Onze" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Demi-Human+Swordmaster+Onze" target="">Demi-Human Swordmaster Onze</a> to earn <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Demi-Human Swordsman Yosh" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Demi-Human+Swordsman+Yosh" target="">Demi-Human Swordsman Yosh</a> (Spirit Ash) as a reward. </p> 
                    <p>The <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Belurat Gaol" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Belurat+Gaol" target="">Belurat Gaol</a> is an optional dungeon situated under the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Belurat Tower Settlement" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Belurat+Tower+Settlement" target="">Belurat Tower Settlement</a>. The entrance can be accessed by heading west from the Abandoned Ailing Village or the Greatbridge, North Site of Grace. You will follow the body of water here and you'll know that you are at the right location when you reach the part where you see metal barricades and prison cages. As you enter the dungeon, you will find the Belurat Gaol Site of Grace and a Summoning Pool on the right side of the entrance. </p> 
                    <p>This area has enemies such as Revered Spirits, large and small variations of the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Living Jar" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Living+Jar" target="">Living Jar</a>, and Mutated Prisoners. This area is also a good place to farm or find <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Frozen Maggot" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Frozen+Maggot">Frozen Maggots</a>. The objective is to reach the bottom-most section of the gaol where a mini-boss is waiting.</p> 
                    <p>As you formally set foot in the location, head down the steps on the left and be ready to block or dodge, a Shadow Undead will ambush you as soon as you approach a doorway along the steps. Head inside the room on the left and you'll find a body you can loot to find x6 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Frozen Maggot" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Frozen+Maggot" target="">Frozen Maggot</a>. Go back outside, and continue going down the steps until you reach the end where the ground collapses. Kill more of the Revered Spirits, and if you look to your left, you'll find another doorway. Be ready again for another spirit who will try to ambush you, kill the enemies, and loot the body lying on the ground to find x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Silver Horn Tender" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Silver+Horn+Tender" target="">Silver Horn Tender</a>. </p> 
                    <p>Go back outside and cross the narrow path to reach the other end. But tread carefully since enemies are roaming around and blocking your path. Kill the two spirits and before you go through the doorway ahead, there is another body you can loot by the edge of the cliff. Loot it to find x4 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Frozen Maggot" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Frozen+Maggot" target="">Frozen Maggot</a>. Go through the doorway and look to your right to see a hole that you can jump through. Proceed to this path, and then jump through the hole on the left side to continue your descent.</p> 
                    <p>Enter the room that looks like a storeroom that is filled with crates, cages, and tables. Kill the enemies and loot the body next to the shelf with barrels on the left side to find x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Broken Rune" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Broken+Rune" target="">Broken Rune</a>. Exit the room, but before you enter the next room on the left, break the crates on the right to find another corpse lying by the edge of a cliff to find x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Thawfrost Boluses" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Thawfrost+Boluses" target="">Thawfrost Boluses</a>. As you pass through the connecting room, you'll see a Ghost Prisoner NPC that you can speak to who begs for forgiveness and fears the jar.</p> 
                    <p>Upon exiting, you'll come across a section of the prison where you'll see large jars chained together and onto the ceiling. Before you make your descent by using the jars as platforms, look ahead to find another doorway that leads to a room with jars and crates. There is a body here that you can loot to find x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow Realm Rune (3)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+Realm+Rune+(3)">Shadow Realm Rune [3]</a>, but at the same time, you'll fight against a Mutated Prisoner, humanoids that have mutated and erupted from their jars. Once you've cleared the room, return to the hanging jars to start descending to the bottom area (there's a body on top of the hanging jar that has x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Glass Shard" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Glass+Shard" target="">Glass Shard</a>). As indicated in the image above, you'll want to try and make your way down towards the side of the room that has a wooden platform. There is a chest there that contains x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Hefty Cracked Pot" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Hefty+Cracked+Pot" target="">Hefty Cracked Pot</a>. </p> 
                    <p>After getting the item, continue to the bottom and proceed west. Clear the enemies along the way and pass through the doorway where you'll enter a shrine-looking section of the gaol. Drop onto the bridge and fight your way against more enemies. When you reach the opposite end, as you approach the altar, the ground beneath you will collapse and you'll fall into a mini-labyrinth that's filled with small and large jars. Take caution here as both <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Living Jar" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Living+Jar" target="">Living Jar</a> and Mutated Prisoners are hiding in corners, waiting to ambush you. </p> 
                    <p>Take the time here to explore the section with pots since there are some items that you can loot: x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Lost Ashes of War" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Lost+Ashes+of+War" target="">Lost Ashes of War</a>, x2 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithing Stone [6]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+[6]" target="">Smithing Stone [6]</a>, x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Greater Potentate's Cookbook (11)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Greater+Potentate's+Cookbook+(11)" target="">Greater Potentate's Cookbook (11)</a>. There are also x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Hefty Cracked Pot" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Hefty+Cracked+Pot" target="">Hefty Cracked Pot</a>, and x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Innard Meat" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Innard+Meat" target="">Innard Meat</a> looted off the bodies that are on top of the large jars. Once you're done clearing the room, proceed east to find the exit leading to the next section. Kill the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Living Jar" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Living+Jar" target="">Living Jar</a> and loot the body sitting on a prison cage to find x2 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithing Stone [3]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+[3]" target="">Smithing Stone [3]</a>.</p> 
                    <p>Before advancing the dungeon further, head west on your compass, and you will find a jar that is slightly at a lower level than your position. Jump on it and it will take you up high. Once it stops, jump towards the following platforms and continue forward. You will find <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Greatjar" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Greatjar" target="">Greatjar</a> on a pedestal. Move forward and drop down to find yourself again in the Jar Labyrinth. Resume your previous way, to continue advancing in the dungeon.</p> 
                    <p>Next, jump across to reach the opposite side of the area to find a golden mist door, and fight the Mutated Prisoners. Position your compass towards the South, and you'll see a chained jar that you can jump on. Use it as a platform to jump across a broken pillar, and continue jumping down until you reach the end, where you'll find a gold mist door. Before you enter, make preparations, as you'll fight against the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Demi-Human Swordmaster Onze" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Demi-Human+Swordmaster+Onze" target="">Demi-Human Swordmaster Onze</a> upon passing through the mist.</p> 
                    <p>The <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Demi-Human Swordmaster Onze" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Demi-Human+Swordmaster+Onze" target="">Demi-Human Swordmaster Onze</a> boss is an agile boss capable of leaping into the air, using lunge attacks, and executing deadly combos similar to a samurai. In our playthrough, our character's build focuses on melee and we had a shield equipped to mitigate attacks as much as possible. As soon as you enter prepare to dodge or block as the boss will teleport to you and follow up with a swinging attack. Since we were facing the boss without the help of other players, we decided to summon the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Black Knife Tiche" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Black+Knife+Tiche" target="">Black Knife Tiche</a> to keep things in check.</p> 
                    <p>The Black Knife Tiche in our opinion is good against this boss since it also moves fast and is capable of attacking its target in close or mid-range. As soon as the boss switched its attention towards our summoned spirit, we took the opportunity to land some attacks before it switched its attention to the character. Play it safe and keep an eye out for its movements since the boss moves quickly. Defeating it rewards the spirit ash <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Demi-Human Swordsman Yosh" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Demi-Human+Swordsman+Yosh" target="">Demi-Human Swordsman Yosh</a>.</p> 
                    <p>To return to the entrance, use the pool of energy at the center of the boss arena to teleport to the entrance of this dungeon, or simply return to the Three-Path Cross - Site of Grace to continue your progression. </p>

                <div class="col-sm-8"> 
                    <p>After exploring Central Gravesite Plain, you will go to the Western section. You can access this area by passing through the archway that <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Redmane Freyja" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Redmane+Freyja" target="">Redmane Freyja</a> is facing, but instead of going up the stairs, head towards the left and stick to the mountainside on your left. You will come across shadow enemies here that you can eliminate for a chance to get <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Rada Fruit" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rada+Fruit" target="">Rada Fruit</a> from them. Go to the left after exiting the archway and navigate the ledge here. You will face hounds and giant bats along the way but you can safely outrun them if you're riding Torrent.</p> 
                    <p>Stick to the wall on your left and turn left as you see the opening. After scaling the cliff here, the first thing you will be doing is to activate the Cliffroad Terminus and the path here can be split into three:</p> 
                    <ul> 
                        <li>First: Explore the gravesite to southwest. This is where you will look for the glimmering <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadowpot" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadowpot" target="">Shadowpot</a>.</li> 
                        <li>Second: Explore Prospect Town directly south of the grace; there's a chest at the top of this building that contains the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Outer God Heirloom" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Outer+God+Heirloom" target="">Outer God Heirloom</a> and a number of items that you can pick up from the ground. Past this area, you will find the Forager Brood and the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Larval Tear" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Larval+Tear" target="">Larval Tear</a> at night at the center of a small illuminated gravesite.</li> 
                        <li>Third: Go past the lake to the east and explore the southern area towards the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Artist's Shack" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Artist's+Shack" target="">Artist's Shack</a> and <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Church of Benediction" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Church+of+Benediction" target="">Church of Benediction</a>. You will pick up the Incursion Painting from the shack. Once you reach the church, there's an area on the cliffside where you can loot <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Pata" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Pata" target="">Pata</a> (a weapon) and the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Oathseeker Knight Set" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Oathseeker+Knight+Set" target="">Oathseeker Knight Set</a>.</li> 
                    </ul> 
                    <p>From here, follow the dirt path and head southwest. This will lead you to a gravesite with more Shadow enemies. Go near the edge and look for an item on the ground near the gravestone heads to obtain the following items:</p> 
                    <ul> 
                        <li><a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Scadutree Fragment" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scadutree+Fragment" target="">Scadutree Fragment</a></li>

                    </ul> 
                    <p>There's also a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Grave Gloveworts" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Grave+Gloveworts">Grave Glovewort</a> that you can collect from one of the corpses here. After this area, head to the opposite side of the cliff and go toward the pond. You will encounter Hounds and Bloodfiend enemies here along the way.</p> 
                    <p>At the edge of the pond, you will see a small altar where you can pick up a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Revered Spirit Ash" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Revered+Spirit+Ash" target="">Revered Spirit Ash</a>. Then, head south of the pond where a hound and Bloodfiends are gathered. You can pick up <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Great Arrow" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Great+Arrow" target="">Great Arrow</a> and a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithing Stone" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone" target="">Smithing Stone</a> from their gathering spot. Continue exploring until you reach the edge south of the pond. You will find a non-hostile servant here who will give you the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Forager Brood Cookbook (2)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Forager+Brood+Cookbook+(2)" target="">Forager Brood Cookbook [2]</a> when interacted with. There's also a nearby illuminated grave where you can pick up a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Larval Tear" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Larval+Tear" target="">Larval Tear</a> from the center. (This area can only be spotted at night.)</p> 
                    <p>Continue navigating this area and go toward the cave where you will encounter a Giant Rat and another <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Curseblade" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Curseblade" target="">Curseblade</a>. You're heading toward where you interacted with the first Site of Grace in the Shadow of Realm but in the area above it. As you reach the edge of the cliff, you will see the "<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Incursion Painting" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Incursion+Painting" target="">Incursion" Painting</a> inside the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Artist's Shack" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Artist's+Shack" target="">Artist's Shack</a>. [<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Interactive Map?id=655238&amp;code=mapD" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=655238&amp;code=mapD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See the location on Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree Map</a>] After going here, explore the southern area to reach the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Church of Benediction" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Church+of+Benediction" target="">Church of Benediction</a>. Go toward the center and pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Blessed Blue Dew Talisman" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Blessed+Blue+Dew+Talisman" target="">Blessed Blue Dew Talisman</a> from the altar. Then, face north and exit the tall and slim archway toward the cliff. Pick up <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Pata" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Pata" target="">Pata</a> and the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Oathseeker Knight Set" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Oathseeker+Knight+Set" target="">Oathseeker Knight Set</a> here.</p> 
                    <p>You can go down here and scale the wall while riding Torrent. This gives you access back to the Gravesite Plain without going back to the Site of Grace in Crossroad Terminus. </p>

                <div class="col-sm-8">
                    <p>Go back to the archway, but now follow the stairs. When you arrive at the main gate of Belurat Tower Settlement, use the Main Gate Cross - Site of Grace, and speak with 2 NPCs near it. You will come to know them as <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Moore" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Moore" target="">Moore</a> and <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Sir Ansbach" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Sir+Ansbach" target="">Sir Ansbach</a>.

Behind Sir Ansback is <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Moore" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Moore" target="">Moore</a>, a merchant you can interact with to buy items.

                    <p>Once you are done speaking to the NPCs or resting at the site of grace, climb to the top of the tall stairs and open the double doors to enter the legacy dungeon. As you approach the first set of stairs, a large <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Spider Scorpion" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Spider+Scorpion" target="">Spider Scorpion</a> ahead will drop from the ceiling and start to attack you. Be ready to dodge as it will jump in the air. The large creature is easy to kill since you can block its attacks with your shield or dodge it at the right time. After killing it, climb to the top and enter the large room.</p> 
                    <p>Head up to the second floor and you'll fight against another large <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Spider Scorpion" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Spider+Scorpion" target="">Spider Scorpion</a>, kill it, and near it, you can find another body on the ground.

                    <p>Inside, you'll find a statue in the middle of the room. Tread carefully as you approach it since there are multiple Spider Scorpion enemies around the statue. Killing the enemies will have a chance to drop <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Scorpion Liver" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scorpion+Liver" target="">Scorpion Liver</a>. Approach the statue after clearing the room to find x2 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Revered Spirit Ash" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Revered+Spirit+Ash" target="">Revered Spirit Ash</a>. Behind the statue, on the right side, there is a body sitting by the wall, you can pillage its remains to find x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow Realm Rune (1)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+Realm+Rune+(1)">Shadow Realm Rune [1]</a>.</p> 
                    <p>Head up to the second floor and you'll fight against another large <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Spider Scorpion" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Spider+Scorpion" target="">Spider Scorpion</a>, kill it, and near it, you can find another body on the ground.

Exit through the door at the top of the steps to formally arrive at the Belurat Tower Settlement, you can find the Belurat Tower Settlement Site of Grace and a Summoning Pool at the top of the stone steps, near the double doors, on the left side.</p> 
                    <p>Next to the site of grace, there is a room you can enter (Ignore the large stone door since this is locked). Defeat the two Revered Spirit enemies and on the right side of the locked door, there is a body on the ground you can loot to find x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Neutralizing Boluses" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Neutralizing+Boluses" target="">Neutralizing Boluses</a>. Go back outside, and head east towards an open section where you'll find a fountain and a waterfall. Around the fountain, there are hostile spirits that are praying to the statue sitting on the fountain. Kill them and you'll also find another body that you can loot to acquire x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Stimulating Boluses" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Stimulating+Boluses" target="">Stimulating Boluses</a>. On the left side, you'll see a stream of water coming from above, approach it to find another body that can be looted to find x3 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Knot Resin" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Knot+Resin" target="">Knot Resin</a>.</p> 
                    <p>On the right-hand side of the fountain, there is a short set of stairs that goes up. Head towards that direction and then make a right where you'll find another fountain with a group of spirits praying. You can kill the enemies easily and find x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Somber Smithing Stone [3]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone+[3]" target="">Somber Smithing Stone [3]</a> on the ground. By the fountain where you got the smithing tone, if you look to the left, you'll see a ladder that goes down to the sewer or well depths. The door there is locked and you need to find the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Well Depths Key" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Well+Depths+Key" target="">Well Depths Key</a> to unlock it. However, you can go ahead and check the area to find x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Messmerfire Grease" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Messmerfire+Grease" target="">Messmerfire Grease</a> on the pile of dead bodies. Climb back up the ladder and explore the east section of the area.</p> 
                    <p>As you walk towards the path, be ready to dodge the magical attacks from the enemies positioned above. Be ready to dash towards the slope that goes up where you'll encounter more Revered Spirits. As you run forward, go right to find an alleyway where you'll find a body. Loot it to find x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Messmerfire Grease" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Messmerfire+Grease" target="">Messmerfire Grease</a>.

Kill the enemies and you loot the nearby corpse to find x3 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Black Pyrefly" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Black+Pyrefly" target="">Black Pyrefly</a>. Turn your camera facing north and you'll find an entrance to a kitchen room. There are three spirit enemies inside the kitchen room. Kill the one standing near the vases and break the objects to find x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Silver Horn Tender" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Silver+Horn+Tender" target="">Silver Horn Tender</a> on the ground.</p> 
                    <p>Head up the stairs and be ready to dodge the mage spirit from its magical attack. Kill it and just next to the arched doorway is the Small Private Altar site of grace. Go through the doorway after activating the site of grace and you'll find a Summoning Pool by the wall. You can explore the rooftops area through the doorway that faces the Summoning Pool to find some items there but tread carefully as there are enemies around.</p> 
                    <p>On the rooftops, there's a body tucked by a corner that holds x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Somber Smithing Stone [4]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone+[4]" target="">Somber Smithing Stone [4]</a>. To find it, go straight until you reach the end towards the locked door of the storeroom, jump over the broken railings on the right, then immediately turn right again. At the end, drop onto the roof, walk straight, and jump onto the narrow beam on the left to reach the rooftop across. Still, on the rooftop section, you can find a body hanging by the edge of one of the roofs. Loot it to find x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Silver Horn Tender" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Silver+Horn+Tender" target="">Silver Horn Tender</a>.</p> 
                    <p>Return to the Small Private Altar site of grace and proceed to the doorway on the right. At the top of the stairs, be ready to fight against an elite enemy, a dual sword-wielding <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Horned Warrior" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Horned+Warrior" target="">Horned Warrior</a>. After killing the enemy, proceed east towards the rubble of destroyed buildings where you'll encounter more Revered Spirits, there's a body you can loot to find x2 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Black Pyrefly" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Black+Pyrefly" target="">Black Pyrefly</a>, and another body by a corner, loot it to find x4 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Thin Beast Bones" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Thin+Beast+Bones" target="">Thin Beast Bones</a>. Continue going straight until you enter a large section that has an altar and a tree in the center. As you approach the altar, an NPC invader, <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Fire Knight Queelign (NPC)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fire+Knight+Queelign+(NPC)" target="">Fire Knight Queelign (NPC)</a>, will appear and fight you.

                    <ul> 
                        <li><strong>NOTE:</strong> If this is your first time encountering the NPC Invader, Fire Knight Queelign, defeating him drops the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Crusade Insignia" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Crusade+Insignia" target="">Crusade Insignia</a> talisman. However, if it's your second encounter, he drops the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Prayer Room Key" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Prayer+Room+Key" target="">Prayer Room Key</a> and <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ash of War: Flame Skewer" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ash+of+War:+Flame+Skewer" target="">Ash of War: Flame Skewer</a>.

                    </ul> 
                    <p>Investigate the altar to find a body that you can pillage to find the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ash of War: Shriek of Sorrow" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ash+of+War:+Shriek+of+Sorrow" target="">Ash of War: Shriek of Sorrow</a>, as well as other bodies around the area to find items such as x10 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Arrow" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Arrow" target="">Arrow</a> looted off a body that's hanging by the edge of some rubble, x3 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Black Pyrefly" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Black+Pyrefly" target="">Black Pyrefly</a> from a body sitting on a bench. Return to the entrance of the altar and navigate to the upper area of the rubble. Proceed north of your compass where you'll find an area where a stream of water is flowing, there's a body next to the steel grate that you can loot to obtain x5 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Redflesh Mushroom" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Redflesh+Mushroom" target="">Redflesh Mushroom</a>, and x4 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring String" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/String" target="">String</a> you can loot by the edge of the stream of water.</p> 
                    <p>Proceed through the doorway on the right to find a storeroom. Climb up the ladder and you'll see a body sitting against a wall next to another arched doorway. Loot it to find the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Storeroom Key" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Storeroom+Key" target="">Storeroom Key</a>. The Storeroom Key can be used to unlock the door near the Small Private Altar Site of Grace. Inside that room, you can find an NPC <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Hornsent Grandam" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Hornsent+Grandam" target="">Hornsent Grandam</a>.</p> 
                    <p>Exit through the doorway and turn left. By the steps, jump on the narrow side of the tiled roof and walk around it. But before you do that, go down the stairs until you reach a dead-end, there's a body hanging by the edge that you can loot to find x3 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Throwing Dagger" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Throwing+Dagger" target="">Throwing Dagger</a>.

This key can be used to open the locked door down at the sewers of the well.</p> 
                    <p>The area ahead is polluted with poison, so be ready to have <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Neutralizing Boluses" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Neutralizing+Boluses" target="">Neutralizing Boluses</a> consumable items to alleviate the build-up of poison or to cure yourself from the effect. This section of the dungeon is also swarming with another type of enemy, the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Man-Fly" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Man-Fly" target="">Man-Fly</a>. They can easily be killed but are deadly if they attack you in a group. To find and unlock a shortcut to the Belurat Tower Settlement site of grace, look southeast of the compass to find a tower with a tall ladder. At the top, you can unlock the door to open the shortcut leading to the Belurat Tower Settlement Site of Grace.</p> 
                    <p>An elite enemy, a toxic variant of the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Lesser Ulcerated Tree Spirit" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Lesser+Ulcerated+Tree+Spirit" target="">Lesser Ulcerated Tree Spirit</a>, can also be found south of the poison-filled area.

                    <p>Past the bridge pathway after defeating the knight enemy, you can go east to a small sewage area infested with Man-Fly enemies, in this section you can find items to loot from dead bodies such as x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Broken Rune" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Broken+Rune" target="">Broken Rune</a>. x8 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Redflesh Mushroom" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Redflesh+Mushroom" target="">Redflesh Mushroom</a>, x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Stanching Boluses" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Stanching+Boluses" target="">Stanching Boluses</a>, and x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Glass Shard" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Glass+Shard" target="">Glass Shard</a>. The path you need to take is on the west side to progress. Head straight towards the stairs, before climbing up, look to the left to find a body hanging by the edge of a broken parapet wall. Loot the body to find x4 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Black Pyrefly" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Black+Pyrefly" target="">Black Pyrefly</a>.</p> 
                    <p>Next, head up the steps, and you'll find a group of Revered Spirits gathered around a large tree. Kill the enemies and on the left side of the tree, you'll find a broken statue that has an item. Loot the item to acquire x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Revered Spirit Ash" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Revered+Spirit+Ash" target="">Revered Spirit Ash</a>. Continue west and head inside a tower building.</p> 
                    <p>As you enter, go right and walk down the stairs. At the end, is a dead-end and a body hanging by the edge of the broken stairs. Loot the body to find x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Somber Smithing Stone [1]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone+[1]" target="">Somber Smithing Stone [1]</a>. Go back and this time climb up the stairs where you'll encounter an elite enemy wielding two circular blades, this enemy is the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Curseblade" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Curseblade" target="">Curseblade</a>. This enemy is quite agile and hits hard, so be cautious when fighting against it as it loves to jump around and move quickly as it attacks. Defeat it and continue climbing to the top where you'll find the Stagefront site of grace. At this point, you should prepare your gear as the next room leads to the arena of a legacy dungeon boss, the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Divine Beast Dancing Lion" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Divine+Beast+Dancing+Lion" target="">Divine Beast Dancing Lion</a>. <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Redmane Freyja" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Redmane+Freyja" target="">Redmane Freyja</a> can be summoned here to assist in battle.</p> 
                    <p>The main boss for this legacy dungeon is the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Divine Beast Dancing Lion" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Divine+Beast+Dancing+Lion" target="">Divine Beast Dancing Lion</a>. Just as its name implies, the towering creature is aggressive, agile, and capable of dancing around to confuse and overwhelm its target. The beast also has a resemblance to a Chinese dragon where individuals move in harmony to perform a dragon dance. Besides its attacks that consist of leaping, jumping, and thrusting, the Divine Beast Dancing Lion will try to catch the player with an unblockable attack where it chomps its prey in the air and forcefully throws the player on the ground. This divine beast is known to be a messenger of the heavens, capable of unleashing storms as their rage sparks. For more guides on how to defeat the boss, please visit the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Divine Beast Dancing Lion" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Divine+Beast+Dancing+Lion" target="">Divine Beast Dancing Lion</a> page.</p> 
                    <p>Defeating the Divine Beast Dancing Lion rewards the player with the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Remembrance of the Dancing Lion" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Remembrance+of+the+Dancing+Lion" target="">Remembrance of the Dancing Lion</a> and drops the head armor piece, the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Divine Beast Head" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Divine+Beast+Head" target="">Divine Beast Head</a>. Upon killing the Dancing Lion, you can activate the Theatre of the Divine Beast Site of Grace. Go east through an arched doorway to find a room that has a lift, step on it to reach an upper floor. Open the large door and you'll find a revered spirit altar on the right, approach it and pick up the x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Revered Spirit Ash" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Revered+Spirit+Ash" target="">Revered Spirit Ash</a>. Next, make your way to the top of the stairs on the left to find a note, the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Tower of Shadow Message" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Tower+of+Shadow+Message" target="">Tower of Shadow Message</a>, near the shadow that's sealed and obscuring the path ahead.</p> 
                    <p>At this point, you've completed the area, but before leaving, fast travel to the Small Private Altar Site of Grace and proceed to the storeroom where the old hag NPC, <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Hornsent Grandam" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Hornsent+Grandam" target="">Hornsent Grandam</a>, can be found. Equip the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Divine Beast Head" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Divine+Beast+Head" target="">Divine Beast Head</a> armor piece, speak to her, and exhaust her dialogue lines to obtain the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Watchful Spirit" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Watchful+Spirit" target="">Watchful Spirit</a> spell. Leave the room and rest at the Small Private Altar site of grace, then return to the NPC and speak to her again to obtain x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Scorpion Stew" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scorpion+Stew" target="">Scorpion Stew</a>. You can give this to Hornsent at the Three-Path Cross Site of Grace to get x3 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Furnace Visage" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Furnace+Visage" target="">Furnace Visage</a>.</p>

                    <p>Return to the Three-Path Cross Site of Grace and speak with the NPCs again. If you have the Scorpion Stew from <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Hornsent Grandam" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Hornsent+Grandam" target="">Hornsent Grandam</a>, you can give it to Hornsent here to get 3x <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Furnace Visage" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Furnace+Visage" target="">Furnace Visage</a>. After doing so, head towards the bridge to your northeast. There are metal barricades along the bridge and as you get closer to the middle, a soldier manning the Ballista will start firing here. As you cross the bridge run near the corpses to pick up <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Lost Ashes of War" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Lost+Ashes+of+War" target="">Lost Ashes of War</a> and <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ballista Bolt" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ballista+Bolt" target="">Ballista Bolt</a> here. Then, once you cross to the other side, eliminate the soldier manning the ballista and the rest of them in this area.</p> 
                    <p>You can pick up a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Scadutree Fragment" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scadutree+Fragment" target="">Scadutree Fragment</a> in the middle of the camp right in front of the Marika Statue, near the short wall separating the dirt path from the tents. You can also see the nearby Castle Front - Site of Grace behind another tent. Walk towards it to activate it. To continue exploring, you will head to <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Fog Rift Catacombs" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fog+Rift+Catacombs" target="">Fog Rift Catacombs</a>. You can reach this place by heading west from the Castle Front - Site of Grace (front of Castle Ensis). You will pass through a small group of army here under a wooden scaffolding. Keep heading west and follow the trail here behind them. You will see gravestones along the way here and make sure to stay on the middle path so you don't come up a cliff. As you head further you will see 2 Ghostflame lanterns in the nearby north direction marking the door to the catacombs.</p> 
                    <p>The entrance of the catacombs leads to an elevator that goes down. You'll immediately find the Fog Rift Catacombs Site of Grace and a tunnel path straight ahead. Head through the tunnel entrance and prepare yourself for a Lion Head Goblin that will ambush you. At the upper right side of the room is a corpse holding a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Grave Glovewort [1]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Grave+Glovewort+[1]" target="">Grave Glovewort [1]</a>.</p> 
                    <p>After retrieving that item, turn left through another tunnel entrance which leads to a large open room. Upon exiting the tunnel, immediately turn left towards a safe spot because half of the room is rigged with a spike trap that descends from above. Wait for it to come down, and once it goes up, immediately run to the other side where a Lion Head Goblin is waiting for you. Take out the Goblin and head straight to the next tunnel entrance leading to a large hallway. Turn right and head straight towards the stairs going down, but before heading down, pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Yellow Fulgurbloom" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Yellow+Fulgurbloom" target="">Yellow Fulgurbloom</a> to your left.</p> 
                    <p>After collecting the plant, head down the stairs and turn right into another tunnel in the catacombs. You'll see a that give you the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ancient Dragon Knight's Cookbook (1)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ancient+Dragon+Knight's+Cookbook+(1)">Ancient Dragon Knight's Cookbook [1]</a> along with a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Yellow Fulgurbloom" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Yellow+Fulgurbloom" target="">Yellow Fulgurbloom</a> plant. Head back to where you turned right earlier, and this time, turn left down another set of stairs. This will lead you to what looks like a dead-end ledge but wait a few seconds for the spike trap from earlier to fall down. Once it falls, hop on top of it, and it will lead you to a secret platform with a Lionhead <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Imp" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Imp" target="">Imp</a>, a corpse that gives you <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Knot Resin" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Knot+Resin" target="">Knot Resin</a>, and a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Yellow Fulgurbloom" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Yellow+Fulgurbloom" target="">Yellow Fulgurbloom</a> plant.</p> 
                    <p>After looting the platform, hop on the spike trap again, but don't go back yet. Instead, wait for the spike trap to take you back up again, and this time, look for a tunnel entrance to the left that you can drop onto. Once you enter the tunnel and the room, turn left again until you cross a bridge and a set of stairs going up. Here, you'll encounter Messmer Soldiers guarding a room. Head inside the room after defeating the Messmer Soldiers, and you'll face a Black Knight. Defeat the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Black Knight" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Black+Knight" target="">Black Knight</a>, then pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Great Ghost Glovewort" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Great+Ghost+Glovewort" target="">Great Ghost Glovewort</a>. Go outside the room, then turn left to jump on top of a spiked platform, then go through a hallway. Follow the pathway and you will find the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Black Knight Commander Andreas" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Black+Knight+Commander+Andreas" target="">Black Knight Commander Andreas</a> summon at the end.</p> 
                    <p>Make your way back to where you first saw the spike area from a ledge. Instead of hopping back on, wait for it to drop and go up. Then immediately drop down and enter the tunnel entrance behind you. The small room here contains a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Yellow Fulgurbloom" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Yellow+Fulgurbloom" target="">Yellow Fulgurbloom</a>. Inside the room on the left side is a ladder going up. Head up the ladder and follow the tunnel path with three <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Yellow Fulgurbloom" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Yellow+Fulgurbloom">Yellow Fulgurblooms</a>.</p> 
                    <p>After looting the plants, walk to the right and drop down to the area from earlier where you saw the spike trap. Drop down again and stand at the tunnel entrance behind you from earlier. Wait for the spike trap to drop, then immediately run to the other side where a set of stairs goes down. Here, you'll find a corpse that gives you x2 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Dragonbolt Grease" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dragonbolt+Grease" target="">Dragonbolt Grease</a>.</p> 
                    <p>Head down the stairs to find another elevator that goes further down. Upon reaching the ground, head straight towards a room with two Lionhead Imps and loot the corpse and plant under the stairs to get x4 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Rada Fruit" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rada+Fruit" target="">Rada Fruit</a> and a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Yellow Fulgurbloom" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Yellow+Fulgurbloom" target="">Yellow Fulgurbloom</a>. From under the stairs, head straight towards the tunnel entrance on the other side of the room, but loot two more <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Yellow Fulgurbloom" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Yellow+Fulgurbloom" target="">Yellow Fulgurbloom</a> plants to the left.</p> 
                    <p>Inside the small room, clear out the two enemies and loot the corpse on the upper right for a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Grave Glovewort [2]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Grave+Glovewort+[2]" target="">Grave Glovewort [2]</a>. After looting the corpse, head out of the room and turn right towards another tunnel entrance with stairs going further down. This leads to an open hallway with spike traps covering half of the hallway. Just as before, run to the left towards a safe space and wait for the spike trap to drop. Once it drops, hug the wall and run straight until you see a hole to the left where you can drop down into what appears to be a sewage area. Once you land in the sewage, head straight for the tunnel entrance ahead and loot the corpse for a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ghost Glovewort [4]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ghost+Glovewort+[4]" target="">Ghost Glovewort [4]</a>.</p> 
                    <p>On the left side of the first sewage room is an entrance to another room. Enter and turn left towards another room containing three <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Yellow Fulgurbloom" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Yellow+Fulgurbloom" target="">Yellow Fulgurbloom</a> plants and a corpse that drops an <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Electrocharge" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Electrocharge" target="">Electrocharge</a>. Exit that room, turn left towards a ladder going up. Climb the ladder and drop down from the platform to find yourself near the hallway spike trap from earlier. Wait for the spike trap to drop, and once it does, run towards the other end of the hallway. Get to the second safe spot to the left, past the hole you dropped into earlier, and loot the corpse there to get a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Glass Shard" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Glass+Shard" target="">Glass Shard</a>. Wait for the spike trap to drop again, then run towards the stairs leading to a casket above that you can loot for a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow Realm Rune (3)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+Realm+Rune+(3)">Shadow Realm Rune [3]</a>.</p> 
                    <p>Once you're done looting, stay on the ledge of the platform you're standing on in front. Wait for the spike trap to drop, and you'll see a small square space on the side of the spike trap that you can hop onto. Hop onto the square platform and let the spike trap raise you to a secret platform above with a chest containing the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ash of War: Blinkbolt" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ash+of+War:+Blinkbolt" target="">Ash of War: Blinkbolt</a>. After looting, hop on top of the spike trap again and run to the other side until you see a small platform to the right to drop onto. You'll see an altar that changes the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Stone-Sheathed Sword" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Stone-Sheathed+Sword" target="">Stone-Sheathed Sword</a> to the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Sword of Darkness" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Sword+of+Darkness" target="">Sword of Darkness</a>.</p> 
                    <p>To the left is a ladder going down. This ladder leads to a secret room with a corpse that gives you a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ghost Glovewort [5]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ghost+Glovewort+[5]" target="">Ghost Glovewort [5]</a>. Loot it, then immediately look to the left to see another hole to drop into. This hole will drop you back to a safe spot from the hallway spike trap from earlier. Wait for the spike trap to drop, and once it does, run to the other side this time instead of the platform from earlier. Be careful in the safe area here as it connects to another spike trap area.</p> 
                    <p>Wait for the spike trap on the other side to drop, then cross towards a tunnel entrance. Loot the corpse in the middle first for a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Broken Rune" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Broken+Rune" target="">Broken Rune</a>. Head through the tunnel entrance to find another elevator that goes down. Drop here and head straight until you reach the yellow mist that leads to the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Death Knight" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Death+Knight" target="">Death Knight</a> boss.</p> 
                    <p>After clearing Fog Rift Catacombs, return to the Castle Front - Site of Grace and head southeast towards a gravesite where you will see Bloodfiends fighting Messmer soldiers. Continue riding ahead until you see the toppled pillars with lit lanterns. You will see a small entrance that will lead to <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ruined Forge Lava Intake" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ruined+Forge+Lava+Intake" target="">Ruined Forge Lava Intake</a>. By the entrance is where you'll find the Ruined Lava Forge Intake Site of Grace.</p> 
                    <p>Head down the stairs, turn right, and then climb down the ladder (or jump down). Go forward and turn left into a dead-end room where you'll encounter a Stone Golem enemy. Kill the enemy and then check the floor of this room to find items such as x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Gas Stone" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Gas+Stone" target="">Gas Stone</a>, x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithing Stone [4]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+[4]" target="">Smithing Stone [4]</a>, and x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithing Stone [1]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+[1]" target="">Smithing Stone [1]</a>. There is also a corpse in this room, sitting against the wall from where the Golem was standing. You can loot the body to obtain x4 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithing Stone [5]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+[5]" target="">Smithing Stone [5]</a>. Proceed to the opposite side where you'll encounter a Fire Blob.</p> 
                    <p>Continue going straight until you enter another room where you'll spot a body lying on the ground, near the railings. Loot the body to find x7 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithing Stone (2)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+(2)">Smithing Stone [2]</a> and also x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithing Stone [1]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+[1]" target="">Smithing Stone [1]</a>, x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithing Stone [3]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+[3]" target="">Smithing Stone [3]</a> on the floor, near the corpse. Proceed to the next section on the left side of the body, then walk to the end, and climb down the ladder. On this floor, you'll encounter more enemies, some smithing stones, and x2 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Gas Stone" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Gas+Stone" target="">Gas Stone</a> that you can pick up. From the ladder, if you look to your right, you'll see some shabby stairs. If you check below, you'll find a corpse that can be looted to obtain x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Somber Smithing Stone (2)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone+(2)">Somber Smithing Stone [2]</a>.</p> 
                    <p>Head up the stairs and you'll find more smithing stones that you can pick up on the ground, including another body that you can loot to acquire <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Greater Potentate's Cookbook (13)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Greater+Potentate's+Cookbook+(13)" target="">Greater Potentate's Cookbook (13)</a>. Around the cookbook item, you can also pick up x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithing Stone [3]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+[3]" target="">Smithing Stone [3]</a> on the ground. If you look behind, you'll find a broken pillar that you can use to walk on. Reach the other side and walk around the narrow pathway where you should find x3 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithing Stone [7]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+[7]" target="">Smithing Stone [7]</a> that you can pick up from the floor.</p> 
                    <p>Turn around, and jump across to reach the narrow sides of the platform. You should spot another corpse sitting by the edge of the narrow sides. Loot it to acquire x2 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithing Stone [4]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+[4]" target="">Smithing Stone [4]</a>.</p> 
                    <p>Go back to the narrow platform and approach the broken pillar that you used to cross, you should find a path that leads to a ladder that you can climb down. On this section, you'll find more smithing stones you can loot, x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Glass Shard" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Glass+Shard" target="">Glass Shard</a> from a body, and a lever that you can pull. Pulling the lever will bring down a large pillar that you can use to cross and reach an upper section of the forge. Next, climb back up the ladder to go back to the previous room, jump down, and proceed west towards a doorway. But before you go through that doorway, look to the left and you'll find another path leading to a dead end. You should find another Golem sitting in front of a corpse that can be looted. This body holds x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Somber Smithing Stone [6]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone+[6]" target="">Somber Smithing Stone [6]</a>. Retrace your steps and head to the doorway, towards the next section.</p> 
                    <p>As you enter the next section, you'll spot another body ahead, next to another Golem, and on the right, is another ladder you can climb down. Before climbing down the ladder, kill the Golem enemy and pillage the body nearby to acquire the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithscript Dagger" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithscript+Dagger" target="">Smithscript Dagger</a> and a Smithing Stone [4] near it.</p> 
                    <p>Now, jump onto the large pipe and walk to the end. Be wary of the Fire Blob that will drop from the ceiling when you're about midway to the top. Look to your right and you'll find a small room with an altar inside. Jump across and interact with the altar to receive x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Anvil Hammer" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Anvil+Hammer" target="">Anvil Hammer</a> and x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ancient+Dragon+Smithing+Stone" target="">Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone</a>. You can fast travel to the entrance by interacting with the white teleporter that appears next to the altar on the right. Outside, you will continue exploring the Eastern Gravesite Plain by heading further southeast.</p> 
                    <p>When you're done exploring Ruined Forge Lava Intake, you will head back outside, then take the path leading south, or teleport to Castle Front - Site of Grace and follow the path. You will encounter some soldiers here on the way gathered at a small camp. Eliminate this small group and then pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Swift Spear" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Swift+Spear" target="">Swift Spear</a> from a corpse next to the wooden barricade.</p> 
                    <p>After this area, stick to the left side and scale the cliff. There's a Site of Grace that you need to activate so you can come back to it later. This is the Pillar Path Cross - Site of Grace where you can speak with an NPC. You can also pick up a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Scadutree Fragment" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scadutree+Fragment" target="">Scadutree Fragment</a>, 2x <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Empyrean-Blood Burgeon" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Empyrean-Blood+Burgeon" target="">Empyrean-Blood Burgeon</a> here next to the cross. You will find Thiollier here seated near the ledge. Speak with him and exhaust his dialogues. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>NOTE</strong></span>: Speak with Moore after meeting Thiollier to receive the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Black Syrup" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Black+Syrup" target="">Black Syrup</a>. You can still get this even after you get the notification that the great rune has been broken. Just make sure to exhaust all his dialogues.</p> 
                    <ul> 
                        <li><strong>The Rivermouth Cave may also be accessed from the Gravesite Plain, however, it is recommended to access this area from Scadu Altus, travel to Rauh Base, and after <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Temple Town Ruins" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Temple+Town+Ruins" target="">Temple Town Ruins</a>.</strong></li>

                    <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><a id="AlternateRivermouth"></a>ALTERNATE</strong></span>: From the Pillar Path Cross - Site of Grace, carefully jump down the rocks behind Thiollier's initial location. Head towards the river and then follow the river going north. This will take you to Ellac River Cave - Site of Grace. Then, continue traveling north to reach the entrance to Rivermouth Cave. This alternate path is recommended if you haven't reached Scadu Altus yet and want to get your hands on <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Bloodfiend Hexer's Ashes" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bloodfiend+Hexer's+Ashes" target="">Bloodfiend Hexer's Ashes</a>, a unique ash dropped by the dungeon boss.</p> 
                    <p>Whether or not you choose to clear Rivermouth Cave, you will return to the Pillar Path Cross - Site of Grace and then return to the main path. Keep an eye out for the Pillar Path Waypoint - Site of Grace, and then, continue southwest until you hear a screaming man. This is <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Igon" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Igon" target="">Igon</a>, a Drake warrior who is screaming in pain. Make sure to talk to him until you exhaust his dialogues and you will find out that the cause of his pain is a powerful boss. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>NOTE</strong></span>: Do not kill this NPC. It is important to keep him alive because he will play an important role against a boss later on.</p> 
                    <p>After this interaction, continue going south, following the path where you found Igon. Players have reported that a hostile NPC version of <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ancient Dragon-Man" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ancient+Dragon-Man" target="">Ancient Dragon-Man</a> appeared here. Keep going until you see a cave to your left with a campfire outside of it's entrance. Go inside and activate the Dragon's Pit - Site of Grace. <strong>For now, we don't recommend exploring this dungeon yet. Instead, come back here much later after exploring <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Cerulean Coast" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Cerulean+Coast" target="">Cerulean Coast</a>, which is when you're going to <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Charo's Hidden Grave" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Charo's+Hidden+Grave" target="">Charo's Hidden Grave</a> from the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Dragon's Pit" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dragon's+Pit" target="">Dragon's Pit</a>.</strong></p> 
                    <p>Head back outside to continue to the Suppressing Pillar. You can reach the pillar by teleporting to the Pillar Path Waypoint - Site of Grace and heading up the ramp that connects it to the higher plain in the eastern Gravesite Plain [<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Interactive Map?id=655293&amp;code=mapD" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=655293&amp;code=mapD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See Shadow of the Erdtree Map</a>]. Upon arriving, simply enter the pillar to find a lift, ride it to the top, and you'll spot a treasure chest that contains x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ancient+Dragon+Smithing+Stone" target="">Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone</a>. There's nothing much else to do here but you can also find a headstone to read a message that says:</p> 
                    <p><em>"The very center of the Lands Between.</em></p> 
                    <p><em>All manners of Death wash up here, only to be suppressed."</em></p> 
                    <p>On clear weather, the top of the Suppressing Pillar provides the best preview of all of the regions of the Realm of Shadow. After reaching the Suppressing Pillar, you will again return to the Castle Front - Site of Grace, use up all your <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Scadutree Fragment" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scadutree+Fragment" target="">Scadutree Fragment</a> and <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Revered Spirit Ash" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Revered+Spirit+Ash" target="">Revered Spirit Ash</a> to get ready to enter Castle Ensis.</p>

                    <p>After exploring Gravesite Plain, you will now enter the Castle Ensis area where a bridge separates it from the main land. Before crossing, go under and shift to the left side of the bridge. You will find trails of illuminated stoneheads which serves as a path to a room that has big barrels along with a body that you can loot. Get the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Spelldrake Talisman  3" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Spelldrake+Talisman++3">Spelldrake Talisman +3</a> from the body, then head back up to cross the bridge.</p> 
                    <p>Once you cross the bridge, there is a body on the left side of the bridge that contains x3 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Black Pyrefly" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Black+Pyrefly" target="">Black Pyrefly</a>. Across the bridge, you will encounter a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Troll Knight" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Troll+Knight" target="">Troll Knight</a> guarding the area. Be ready for combat, as this can be a tough enemy to defeat. After killing the Troll Knight, you will see an entrance to a room on the right. Once you enter it, you will encounter a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Lazuli Sorcerer" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Lazuli+Sorcerer" target="">Lazuli Sorcerer</a>. Once you have dealt with the enemy, there will be a body in the immediate left corner of the room containing a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow Realm Rune (4)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+Realm+Rune+(4)">Shadow Realm Rune [4]</a>.

                    <p>After clearing the building, follow the path opposite the building leading to a stairway heading deeper into the castle. On the western side by the cliff before the walls, you can loot a dead body that has x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Somber Smithing Stone [1]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone+[1]" target="">Somber Smithing Stone [1]</a>.

Head up the stairs that the Exile Soldier and Rotten Stray were guarding on the left side, and you'll find yourself in an area with a ladder. Climb up the ladder to find a chest containing the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Milady" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Milady" target="">Milady</a> [<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Interactive Map?id=655119&amp;code=mapD" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=655119&amp;code=mapD">See Elden Ring Map</a>], a light greatsword.</p> 
                    <p>Find your way back down the ladder and the stairs to a small cavern directly facing the stairs. Keep following the cavern, and you will find a body containing an item that you cannot reach yet.

Follow the first ramp heading up, and you will see two <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Messmer Foot Soldier" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Messmer+Foot+Soldier">Messmer Foot Soldiers</a> gathering around a bonfire and a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Lesser Black Knight" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Lesser+Black+Knight" target="">Lesser Black Knight</a> nearby, so be prepared to engage them in combat. After dealing with the enemies, if you look down by the cliff before the bonfire area, you can drop safely into an area below. You will find remains resting right on the ledge containing x10 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Bolt" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bolt" target="">Bolt</a>. Behind the remains will be the cavern that you went through earlier, and you will get to loot the body you saw earlier, containing x3 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Glintslab Firefly" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Glintslab+Firefly" target="">Glintslab Firefly</a>.</p> 
                    <p>Backtrack your way to the ramps. You'll encounter a Black Knight near the first ramp. On the first ramp, you'll find a room to the left that has a chest containing the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Loyal Knight's Cookbook" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Loyal+Knight's+Cookbook" target="">Loyal Knight's Cookbook</a> [<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Interactive Map?id=655123&amp;code=mapD" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=655123&amp;code=mapD">See Elden Ring Map</a>]. Head back outside, then go up the second ramp. In the middle of the second ramp, you'll find a pathway leading to a body with an item. A <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Rotten Stray" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rotten+Stray" target="">Rotten Stray</a> is hiding around the corner, so be careful as you approach to loot the body.

Go back to the ramp and keep following it. At the top of the ramp, you will find a closed gate. Look over to the left of the gate, and you will pick up x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Castle Cross Message" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Castle+Cross+Message" target="">Castle Cross Message</a>. You will also find a cross, and 1x <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Scadutree Fragment" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scadutree+Fragment" target="">Scadutree Fragment</a>. Near the Scadutree Fragment drop, you will find the Castle Ensis Checkpoint Site of Grace [<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Interactive Map?id=655128&amp;code=mapD" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=655128&amp;code=mapD">See Elden Ring Map</a>].

                    <p>On the right side of the locked gate, there will be an Messmer Soldier looking towards an area below. Dispose of the soldier, then jump down the area. You'll find a body immediately after the first jump which contains x3 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Knot Resin" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Knot+Resin" target="">Knot Resin</a>. You'll notice a hole leading to a cavern in the ground. You can jump safely below, and you will deal with three Rotten Strays immediately after dropping down. You can loot a body for x10 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Arrow" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Arrow" target="">Arrow</a> beside where you dropped. Follow the path of the cavern. You will find yourself on a cliffside path. The path to your right leads to the rooftop of the structure that you looted near the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Troll Knight" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Troll+Knight" target="">Troll Knight</a>. Be careful as you're traversing the path, as there is a small gap that you need to jump right before the rooftop. As you get to the rooftop, you will find an <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring eagle" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/eagle" target="">eagle</a> in front of a body on the other end. Loot the body to find x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Starlight Shards" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Starlight+Shards" target="">Starlight Shards</a>.</p> 
                    <p>Head back to the junction of the cliffside path, then follow the left path leading to a waterfall. Jump on the rocks of the waterfall to get on top of it. You will see two <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring turtle" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/turtle">turtles</a> on the left side, and an archway leading to an area with a ladder on the left side leading to a room and a cavern behind a waterfall. There is a dead body on the left side before the cavern entrance which contains x3 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Drawstring Royal Magic Grease" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Drawstring+Royal+Magic+Grease" target="">Drawstring Royal Magic Grease</a>. At the end of the cavern, you will find a dead body which you can loot for x4 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Knot Resin" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Knot+Resin" target="">Knot Resin</a>. Head back outside the cavern, then climb up the ladder. As you enter the room, you'll encounter two Messmer Soldiers. Deal with the enemies, then head through the doorway in the far-left corner of the room.</p> 
                    <p>The area outside will be the locked gate you encountered earlier, which you can open by pushing the lever inside the room directly across from where you came from. Head up the stairs, and you end up on a bridge with four Messmer Soldiers. The fourth soldier uses a heavy crossbow if you are not in melee-range, so be cautious of that. On the left side of the other end of the bridge, you can loot a body to receive x3 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring String" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/String" target="">String</a>. Follow the path leading south right after the bridge. Be careful here, as there is a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Rotten Stray" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rotten+Stray" target="">Rotten Stray</a> hiding in the bushes on the right just as the path gets tighter. You will end up on a cliffside path.</p> 
                    <p>Follow the path on the right, and you will face two <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Noble Sorcerer" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Noble+Sorcerer">Noble Sorcerers</a> right before a staircase. There will also be a dead body on the left that you can loot for x2 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Glintslab Firefly" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Glintslab+Firefly" target="">Glintslab Firefly</a>. You can easily deal with the first Noble Sorcerer as you can attack it easily. However, to deal with the second Noble Sorcerer, you can follow a path on the right of the stairs that leads to a ladder that you can climb to get on top of a fort. At the top of the fort, you will face a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Page" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Page" target="">Page</a>.

You can also access the area by jumping on the cliff from where the ladder is located.</p> 
                    <p>After dealing with the enemies before the staircase, you can then proceed by going up the stairs. You will then end up right outside of a structure being guarded by an NPC Invader, <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Moonrithyll, Carian Knight" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Moonrithyll,+Carian+Knight" target="">Moonrithyll, Carian Knight</a>.

                    <p>After clearing the chapel, head to the hallway near the entrance of the chapel, in which you'll encounter a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Lazuli Sorcerer" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Lazuli+Sorcerer" target="">Lazuli Sorcerer</a>. You can obtain x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow Realm Rune (2)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+Realm+Rune+(2)">Shadow Realm Rune [2]</a> from a dead body in the hallway.

You will encounter another Lazuli Sorcerer right around the corner of the hallway just after the dead body. If you did not clear the previous room, the enemy will come out right as you fight the other Lazuli Sorcerer in the hallway.</p> 
                    <p>After killing the Lazuli Sorcerers, continue following the hallway, which leads to an area outside. There will be a dead body ahead which you can loot for x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Glintslab Firefly" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Glintslab+Firefly" target="">Glintslab Firefly</a>. A <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Noble Sorcerer" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Noble+Sorcerer" target="">Noble Sorcerer</a> will be attacking you on top of a structure. If you have ranged attacks, you can easily dispose of this enemy. At the landing of the stairs, there will be a gate on the south side that you can open. On the left immediate of the gate you opened, there will be an area below that you can jump down to. You can pick up x3 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Dewgem" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dewgem" target="">Dewgem</a> from a dead body sitting by the cliff.

                    <p>Backtrack your way to the gate that you opened and traverse the path. You will encounter an Exile Soldier that you can get a jump on as it is facing the other way.

The other path, which is the one above the stairs leading down, also has an Exile Soldier that you can easily deal with. After dealing with the enemies, you can loot two dead bodies, one containing x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Somber Smithing Stone [6]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone+[6]" target="">Somber Smithing Stone [6]</a> and x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Somber Smithing Stone [5]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone+[5]" target="">Somber Smithing Stone [5]</a>.</p>

                    <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>IMPORTANT</strong></span>: While you're in this area, you may get a loud notification if you get too close to Shadow Keep about a great rune breaking. This event signifies NPC quests progressions, and you need to speak to them at their respective Sites of Grace. This will also undo the seal preventing entry to Stone Coffin Fissure. (<strong>THIS STILL NEEDS TO BE CONFIRMED BUT SOME PLAYERS HAVE REPORTED THAT YOU WILL NOT GET LOCKED OUT OF ANY QUESTLINE AFTER GETTING THIS NOTIFICATION BUT WILL PROMPT MOVEMENTS FROM DIFFERENT NPCS <span style="color: #ff0000;">AFTER YOU TALK TO THEM</span>. However, some of these NPCs will enter Shadow Keep as part of their questlines so it's important to talk to them before you enter Shadow Keep.

                    <p>Walk to the southern edge of the Church of the Crusade and look for the walls enveloping the Fog Rift Fort. Carefully scale down this path and drop down the rocky platforms to land on one of the fort's towers. Drop down from the tower by jumping or using the ladder, and you'll encounter Messmer Soldiers on top of the fort's walls. Once you take them out, look to your left and you'll see a corpse that you can loot, which has x10 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Fire Arrow" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fire+Arrow" target="">Fire Arrow</a>.</p> 
                    <p>Afterward, follow the path until you reach the second wall tower of the fort. Here, you'll encounter a wooden bridge to your right guarded by six Messmer Soldiers. The wooden bridge leads to a rocky platform with another corpse that you can loot for the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Greater Potentate's Cookbook (3)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Greater+Potentate's+Cookbook+(3)">Greater Potentate's Cookbook [3]</a>.</p> 
                    <p>After looting the corpse on the rocky platform, head back to the wall of the fort by crossing the bridge again and continuing on the path. Turn left to another bridge that leads to a small stone house on the other side, where you'll encounter a boss. For a complete guide on how to beat the boss, check out <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Black Knight Garrew" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Black+Knight+Garrew" target="">Black Knight Garrew</a>. This boss drops the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Black Steel Greatshield" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Black+Steel+Greatshield" target="">Black Steel Greatshield</a>.

                    <p>Next, head towards the small opening between the cliff and the left side of the stone house. Drop down on a ledge. Follow the stairs, then climb two sets of ladders to reach the top of a tower with a treasure chest containing the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Arrow's Soaring Sting Talisman" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Arrow's+Soaring+Sting+Talisman">Arrow's Soaring Sting Talisman</a>. Drop back down the ladder and jump on the cliff in front of it, then jump down to return to where the boss was.<br>Now, head to the right of the stone house and access a small part of the wall path. You'll encounter two more Messmer Soldiers and find another corpse holding x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Somber Smithing Stone [2]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone+[2]" target="">Somber Smithing Stone [2]</a>. Once you've cleared out the walls of the fort, head back to the bridge that connected the wall path and the boss area, then turn left to a wooden platform with a ladder going down. This will lead you to the grounds of the fort where more Messmer Soldiers await you. The first three soldiers you'll encounter are stationed to the left of the ladder near a spike barricade. After taking them out, you'll find a corpse in the middle of the barricade that holds the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Messmerfire Grease" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Messmerfire+Grease" target="">Messmerfire Grease</a>.</p> 
                    <p>After looting the corpse, be careful when combatting the rest of the soldiers on the ground. Luckily, they are spread out and in the open, so you can take them out one by one using a ranged weapon. These soldiers are also stationed next to fire turrets. There are two fire turrets in front, two on the opposite side of where you are, and one on the right.</p> 
                    <p>Once you've cleared out the ground, head to the opposite side of the ground where you'll find some tents. One of these tents contains a chest with the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Serpent Flail" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Serpent+Flail" target="">Serpent Flail</a>.

                    <p>Return to Highroad Cross - Site of Grace and read the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Monk's Missive" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Monk's+Missive" target="">Monk's Missive</a>.

                    <p>Continue to Moorth Ruins where you will be fighting phantom enemies, which can be difficult to see at night. Locate the single withered tree at the center of the ruins. This will serve as the marker for this location filled with debris and remains of war-ravaged buildings. Look for the toppled arch to the southeast and head towards it. Once you reach the arch, align yourself directly east and head towards the withered tree in front of you. Behind this tree, you will find an altar where you can pick up x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Revered Spirit Ash" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Revered+Spirit+Ash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revered Spirit Ash</a>.

Walk towards the northwest where you see a slanted piece of structure. Jump down the balcony near it and to the ground. You can pick up a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow Sunflower" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+Sunflower" target="">Shadow Sunflower</a> from a corpse below the balcony. Then, head to the small cave opening here with a faint ghostflame.

                    <p>Use the Site of Grace after exiting the well. Look around and you will see multiple jars in the area. This area appears to be filled with them in every corner, but they are not alive. You will be fighting shadow enemies here and encounter a Greater Potentate. You will find <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Redflesh Mushroom" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Redflesh+Mushroom" target="">Redflesh Mushroom</a> in the area or pick them up after defeating shadow enemies.

                    <p>You will find spiked barricades and broken cages on either side of the path. Continue following this path and be careful of the 2 Giant Scorpions that will attack you from either side. Keep an eye out for an opening to the right side of the wall. When you see it, enter the cave to go to <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Bonny Gaol" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bonny+Gaol" target="">Bonny Gaol</a>.</p> 
                    <p>Inside the Gaol, you will find jars suspended in the air with chains holding them up. You will be fighting Living Jars and other types of enemies down here.

Inside the second room, you will see an item on a corpse in the corner. Be careful as you approach this chair because 3 Shadow enemies will attack you. After defeating them, take the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Bolt" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bolt" target="">Bolt</a> from the corpse. </p>

Return to the path and use the ladder at the end of this narrow cave and as you exit, watch out for the living jar that will attack you. It can extend its innards to shoot a projectile but you can stagger this enemy with a heavy attack. Inside this room, take the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Stalwart Horn Charm 2" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Stalwart+Horn+Charm+2">Stalwart Horn Charm +2</a>.

                    <p>Return to the sewer area where you jumped down. You will see an unreachable item in the western area because of the grills blocking the way. Look for the narrow area here and watch out for the slug-like enemies down here. They can be difficult to spot because of their color so listen closely to their sounds. This path will lead to a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Broken Rune" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Broken+Rune" target="">Broken Rune</a> that you can pick up from a corpse.

                    <p>When you reach the area where you can see broken jails on the wall to your right, you need to watch out for an enemy that will jump at you in the next room.

                    <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>NOTE</strong></span>: Going past the bridge to the Eastern Scadu Altus will trigger <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring NPCs" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/NPCs" target="">NPCs</a> questline progression where a great rune breaks. This event prompts the advancement of NPCs' questline and will require you to speak with them by teleporting to various Site of Graces. To minimize backtracking, head to the Moorth Ruins grace and clear the remaining areas near it.</p> 
                    <p>From Moorth Ruins - Site of Grace, head southwest past the main path. Then, head to <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ruined Forge of Starfall Past" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ruined+Forge+of+Starfall+Past" target="">Ruined Forge of Starfall Past</a>; this is an optional location but a good place to earn a number of <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithing Stones" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stones" target="">Smithing Stones</a> and you can also get the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ancient Meteoric Ore Greatsword" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ancient+Meteoric+Ore+Greatsword" target="">Ancient Meteoric Ore Greatsword</a> from there.</p>

Before entering, look for the Forager Brood located just west-northwest of the Ruined Forge of Starfall Site of Grace, along the cliffside. Interact with the pest to receive <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Forager Brood Cookbook (1)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Forager+Brood+Cookbook+(1)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forager Brood Cookbook [1]</a>. Enter the dungeon where its entrance is a broken-down structure with a small tunnel entrance on the west side. Enter the tunnel and follow it until you reach a ladder that descends further underground. Climb down the ladder to find an abandoned shelter, where the Ruined Forge of Starfall Past - Site of Grace is located.</p> 
                    <p>After setting up the Site of Grace, head immediately to the doorway and you'll find a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithing Stone [6]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+[6]" target="">Smithing Stone [6]</a> on the ground. Additionally, on the left corner of the area, there are x5 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithing Stone [3]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+[3]" target="">Smithing Stone [3]</a>. In the first area, you'll encounter two Misbegotten enemies. One is below the small bridge that connects to the other side of the room, and the other is on the far side of the bridge. Eliminate these enemies and pull the lever on the other side of the bridge, which will open an iron door below the bridge on the left side. Before heading down to the iron door, go to the opposite side of the lever to find x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithing Stone (2)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+(2)">Smithing Stone [2]</a> and a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithscript Spear" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithscript+Spear" target="">Smithscript Spear</a>.

You'll need to take cover here for a few seconds because a Fire Blob will shoot fire projectiles from the other side of the passage</p> 
                    <p>You can pull the lever in your hiding spot to close the iron door again. Once another projectile crosses, run toward the Fire Blob and take it out. In the next area, there are two levels and another passage to the right leading to another area. From the entrance of the iron passage, go left to grab the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithing Stone [6]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+[6]" target="">Smithing Stone [6]</a> and <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithing Stone [3]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+[3]" target="">Smithing Stone [3]</a> on the ground. A Golem Smith is lurking behind some rubble, so be alert and take it out. To the left of the golem are x2 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithing Stone (2)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+(2)">Smithing Stone [2]</a>.</p> 
                    <p>Once you've looted the first level of the second area, go to the other passage on the right. As before, another Fire Blob will be shooting projectiles from the far side. Run to the nearest cover on the right, but be ready to fight, as another Fire Blob will be waiting to ambush you there. Take out the hiding Fire Blob and wait in cover. There's also a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithing Stone [3]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+[3]" target="">Smithing Stone [3]</a> in the cover area. Wait for a projectile to cross, then run toward the Fire Blob and take it out. Through the second passage, you'll come across a ladder going up to the right. Before heading up, go straight a bit to a small dead-end area and prepare to fight a Golem Smith hiding on the left. This small room contains a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Somber Smithing Stone [7]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone+[7]" target="">Somber Smithing Stone [7]</a> by a skeleton and a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithing Stone [3]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+[3]" target="">Smithing Stone [3]</a>.</p> 
                    <p>Afterward, head up the ladder to reach the second level of this area. Follow the path to a room filled with three Fire Blobs and a Golem Smith. There's a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Somber Smithing Stone [8]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone+[8]" target="">Somber Smithing Stone [8]</a> by a corpse on the ground, so pick it up. Head up the broken-down rubble to the left to reach the third level and enter the passage to the right. This will lead you back to the second area you encountered earlier, and you can drop to the second level. Before jumping to the second level, look to the left to see a small dead-end room with a corpse holding the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithing Talisman" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Talisman" target="">Smithing Talisman</a>. Enter this dead-end room, and a group of Fire Blobs will drop from the ceiling, which you need to take out</p> 
                    <p>There's a Golem Smith on the right side of the area near the bridge and a Fire Blob on a small platform once you drop down. Once you take out the golem, you can loot the second level of the second area. There's a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithing Stone [8]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+[8]" target="">Smithing Stone [8]</a> by a sitting corpse on the small platform. Crossing the bridge to the other side, you can pick up a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithing Stone [6]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+[6]" target="">Smithing Stone [6]</a> and a Glass Shard. Once you've looted the second level, pull the lever to open another iron door on the left side. Enter the iron door and follow the path to a mid-sized room with two Golem Smiths ready to ambush you—one to the right and one to the left. Once you clear the room, you can loot it to find a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithing Stone [6]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+[6]" target="">Smithing Stone [6]</a> and a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithscript Cirque" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithscript+Cirque" target="">Smithscript Cirque</a> by a corpse next to the sewage waterfall.</p> 
                    <p>Do not drop down the sewage waterfall as it will kill you. Instead, head back to the passage that connects the second area and the room with the sewage waterfall. Pull the lever to the left to activate the iron door. Before the iron door rises to close, immediately jump above the iron door. Once it stops, go to the platform on the right to find an entrance to a small room. This room contains an altar that you can interact with to receive the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ancient Meteoric Ore Greatsword" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ancient+Meteoric+Ore+Greatsword" target="">Ancient Meteoric Ore Greatsword</a> and an <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ancient+Dragon+Smithing+Stone" target="">Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone</a>.</p> 
                    <p>You will notice that there's an area above Fort of Reprimand and you can access this by going to the edge of the cliff to the east. You will find a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Spiritspring" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Spiritspring" target="">Spiritspring</a> here but you can't use it right away. You need to look for the stack of stones by going to the edge of the cliff here. Then, summon <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Torrent" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Torrent" target="">Torrent</a> to ride up the plain above you. From there, head southeast to reach the edge and you will find the Scaduview Cross and Site of Grace. You can pick up x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Scadutree Fragment" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scadutree+Fragment" target="">Scadutree Fragment</a> here next to <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Miquella's Cross" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Miquella's+Cross" target="">Miquella's Cross</a>.

There will be an Omenkiller patrolling the courtyard, so be prepared for combat. After defeating the Omenkiller, you are free to explore and loot the area. You can pick up numerous items in the courtyard, such as <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Throwing Dagger" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Throwing+Dagger" target="">Throwing Dagger</a>, <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Broken Rune" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Broken+Rune" target="">Broken Rune</a>, <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Grace Mimic" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Grace+Mimic" target="">Grace Mimic</a>, <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Furlcalling Finger Remedy" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Furlcalling+Finger+Remedy" target="">Furlcalling Finger Remedy</a>, and <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Blessed Bone Shard" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Blessed+Bone+Shard" target="">Blessed Bone Shard</a>.

As you head deeper into the basement, you will find an exit leading to a section behind the fort. You'll find x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Messmer Soldier Ashes" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Messmer+Soldier+Ashes" target="">Messmer Soldier Ashes</a> by a gravestone. You'll also find a ladder going up the fort, so use that to go back inside the fort.</p> 
                    <p>After climbing the ladder, you will end up on top of the fort walls. Follow the path to the right, then head left, looting a dead body by the stairs containing x3 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Dewgem" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dewgem" target="">Dewgem</a>. To the northwest of the body, you can activate the Fort of Reprimand Site of Grace [<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Interactive Map?id=655051&amp;code=mapD" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=655051&amp;code=mapD">See Elden Ring Map</a>]. An Omenkiller will be on top of the wall on your right, so be prepared to fight it. After defeating the Omenkiller, you can explore the western side of the Site of Grace, finding x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Blessed Bone Shard" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Blessed+Bone+Shard" target="">Blessed Bone Shard</a> on a dead body on a scaffolding.</p> 
                    <p>Go back to the staircase near the Site of Grace, then head south, where you dropped earlier. You'll find a room in which you will encounter <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Black Knight Edreed" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Black+Knight+Edreed" target="">Black Knight Edreed</a>, who uses a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring twinblades" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/twinblades">twinblade</a> in combat. He can also use flying attacks to close the distance to you, so be cautious of those attacks. After you have defeated Black Knight Edreed, he will drop the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ash of War: Aspects of the Crucible: Wings" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ash+of+War:+Aspects+of+the+Crucible:+Wings" target="">Ash of War: Aspects of the Crucible: Wings</a>.  </p> 
                    <p>Head up the stairs, then climb up the ladder, which leads to the outside. On the southwestern part of the area, climb up the stairs. On top of the tower, you can open a chest to acquire x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Battlefield Priest's Cookbook (2)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Battlefield+Priest's+Cookbook+(2)">Battlefield Priest's Cookbook [2]</a>. Backtrack your way to the Fort of Reprimand Site of Grace. You will find a path going down near where you dropped. Go down the stairs and keep following the path. You will encounter numerous Common Soldiers in this area, which you can easily kill in a few attacks. In the room, as you enter the area, you can pick up x2 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Festive Grease" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Festive+Grease" target="">Festive Grease</a> from a dead body right beside where two soldiers are. Go through the cages east of the dead body, leading you to a chest that contains x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Flamedrake Talisman 3" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Flamedrake+Talisman+3">Flamedrake Talisman +3</a>. Head west, then southwest to explore the area, entering another room.  </p> 
                    <p>In this room, you will find a ladder going down right across the door you just entered. When you go down, you will find four Common Soldiers gathering at the southwestern corner of the room. You can find pick up 7x <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithing Stone [5]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+[5]" target="">Smithing Stone [5]</a> on a dead body at the corner where the soldiers were gathering.

This is your last stop before exploring the rest of Scadu Altus. When you're done here, you will now teleport to Bonny Village - Site of Grace to cross the bridge that will let you access Eastern Scadu Altus.</p> 
                    <p>From the Site of Grace, cross the bridge to the east and go to the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Whipping Hut" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Whipping+Hut" target="">Whipping Hut</a> found at the edge of this isolated plain. Pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Tooth Whip" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Tooth+Whip" target="">Tooth Whip</a> from the corpse inside the hut. You can also interact with the ghost here just outside the hut. </p> 
                    <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>ADDITIONAL INFO</strong></span>: You will notice that if you look at our <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Interactive Map?id=655299&amp;code=mapD" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=655299&amp;code=mapD">Shadow of the Erdtree Map</a>, you will see 2 locations beneath this area: <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Eastern Nameless Mausoleum" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Eastern+Nameless+Mausoleum" target="">Eastern Nameless Mausoleum</a> and <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Darklight Catacombs" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Darklight+Catacombs" target="">Darklight Catacombs</a>.

Read Part 1 of Shadow Keep to know the full details of draining the water in the Shadow Keep - Church District and how to reach both optional dungeons and a new area after that.</p> 
                    <p>Going back to Scadu Altus Eastern Region, cross the bridge to the other side and activate the Bridge Leading to the Village - Site of Grace to the right. it was in this location past the bridge when we heard a loud audio cue followed by a notification that a great rune had broken. This significantly adds interactions you will have with <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring NPCs" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/NPCs" target="">NPCs</a>. <a id="charm"></a>It is recommended to travel to the various sites of graces to speak with the following <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring NPCs" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/NPCs" target="">NPCs</a>: </p> 
                    <ul> 
                        <li>Main Gate Cross - Site of Grace: <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ansbach" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ansbach" target="">Ansbach</a> and <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Moore" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Moore" target="">Moore</a></li> 
                        <li>Three-Path Cross - Site of Grace: <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Redmane Freyja" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Redmane+Freyja" target="">Redmane Freyja</a></li> 
                        <li>Highroad Cross - Site of Grace: <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Needle Knight Leda" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Needle+Knight+Leda" target="">Needle Knight Leda</a> and <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Hornsent" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Hornsent" target="">Hornsent</a></li> 
                        <li>Pillar Path Cross - Site of Grace: <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Thiollier" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Thiollier" target="">Thiollier</a></li> 
                    </ul> 
                    <p><strong>Talking to Moore</strong></p> 
                    <p>Moore will ask you "Must we be sad forever?" Your answer here will affect his questline. You have 3 options:</p> 
                    <ul> 
                        <li>Put it behind you</li> 
                        <li>Remain sad forever</li> 
                        <li>I don't know</li> 
                    </ul> 
                    <p>If you choose the first one, he will move on from this location and you will encounter him later as an enemy. The second one will prompt him to move to a different location and all the Forager Broods will disappear. Don't choose this if you haven't collected all 7 cookbooks from them. The safest choice if you're still doing his quest is the third option which allows you to come back and talk to him later, however, you can also make this your final choice if you progress too far in the game. This will make him stay at the same location and give you a chance to collect all the cookbooks.</p> 
                    <p>The other NPC that you need to make a choice with is Needle Knight Leda, she will ask your opinion on who she should go after. During this conversation, we recommend Hornsent so that once you enter Shadow Keep through the Main Gate, you will assist Hornsent to defeat Leda together, and you will get additional rewards. For the rest of the conversations with other NPCs, you will not have any choices but you need to exhaust all of their dialogues. The others will tell you how they're now beginning to question their choices, and if their decisions were earnest.</p> 
                    <p>You can do this after exploring the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Cathedral of Manus Metyr" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Cathedral+of+Manus+Metyr" target="">Cathedral of Manus Metyr</a> and will not cancel any questlines. So for now, follow the path towards the north where you will reach an area with Wolves and a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Furnace Golem" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Furnace+Golem" target="">Furnace Golem</a>. Defeating the Furnace Golem here will drop <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Cerulean-Sapping Cracked Tear" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Cerulean-Sapping+Cracked+Tear" target="">Cerulean-Sapping Cracked Tear</a> and a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Furnace Visage" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Furnace+Visage" target="">Furnace Visage</a>.

This is a tower building with some of its steps destroyed. You will also see some glowing crystals on the ground floor.</p> 
                    <p>Go through the door to your left and climb the spiral stairs. When you reach the study room with tall bookshelves lined on the walls, make sure to hit the wall with 2 arches. This is a secret wall hiding the key to the sealed spiritspring. Destroy it to reveal a nearby <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Spiritspring" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Spiritspring" target="">Spiritspring</a> outside Rabbath's Rise. You can't use the elevator yet, so you need to go outside the tower and look for the spirit spring. Summon Torrent and ride up the wind to reach the top of the tower. Open the chest to get <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Rabbath's Cannon" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rabbath's+Cannon" target="">Rabbath's Cannon</a>. On your way down, you can now use the elevator that was previously stuck.</p> 
                    <p>When you're finished exploring Rabbath's Rise, return to the Church District Highroad - Site of Grace and pass the time until nightfall. From here, ride directly west to find glowing gravestones surrounding a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Larval Tear" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Larval+Tear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Larval Tear</a>. Southwest from here, past multiple groups of wolves, you will find a small cave opening on your left along the cliff face. Inside you will find a teardrop scarab on the ceiling containing the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ash of War: Carian Sovereignty" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ash+of+War:+Carian+Sovereignty" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ash of War: Carian Sovereignty</a>.</p> 
                    <p>Once you've finished exploring you can now head to the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Cathedral of Manus Metyr" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Cathedral+of+Manus+Metyr" target="">Cathedral of Manus Metyr</a>, which is just across from Rabbath's Rise. From the Site of Grace, stay on the path starting west and follow it south up the hill. Enter the cathedral in front of you and activate the Site of Grace. Open the closed gates and walk in the middle towards the seated man. This is Count Ymir, the head of Manus Metyr. During your interaction with Count Ymir, he will give you 2 items:</p> 
                    <ul>

                    </ul> 
                    <p>While here, be sure to speak with Swordnight Jolan, who is leaning against a pillar nearby. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>NOTE</strong></span>: If you can't find her here, try resting at a site of grace and reload the location. She is a servant to Count Ymir and is fiercely loyal to him. For now, there's not much that you can do to progress their quest, except to roam around the area. Head outside through the arch near Jolan which will take you to the grave area. Summon Torrent and jump over the fence to your left to explore the edges of the Cathedral. Beware of skeleton enemies here and make sure to pick up a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Glinting Nail" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Glinting+Nail" target="">Glinting Nail</a> on the ground. Continue going around the cathedral and eliminate skeleton enemies as you go.

Then, head southeast where you see a broken stone chalice to pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Starlight Shards" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Starlight+Shards" target="">Starlight Shards</a>. This is your last stop in Scadu Altus, and your next step is to teleport to the NPC locations and to their respective Site of Graces to learn from them since a powerful charm had been broken.</p> 
                    <p><strong>Your next stop is <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Rauh Base" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rauh+Base" target="">Rauh Base</a> in <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Rauh Ruins" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rauh+Ruins" target="">Rauh Ruins</a>. </strong>You will get there from <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Moorth Ruins" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Moorth+Ruins" target="">Moorth Ruins</a> and you can continue reading the next section to find out how to reach the next location.<strong> <span style="color: #ff0000;">NOTE</span>: </strong>Make sure to speak with NPCs after this area by teleporting to their respective Sites of Grace.</p>

                    <p>You can reach Rauh Base by teleporting to Moorth Ruins - Site of Grace. Head north where you see a lake with glowing worm-like creatures and a small cave opening. You can also pick up <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Four-Toed Fowl Foot" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Four-Toed+Fowl+Foot" target="">Four-Toed Fowl Foot</a> from a corpse as you approach the lake. When you get to the cave opening, make sure to pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Scadutree Fragment" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scadutree+Fragment" target="">Scadutree Fragment</a> from the mid-sized Statue of Marika here. There are some enemies inside, a mix of <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Miranda Sprout" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Miranda+Sprout" target="">Miranda Sprout</a> and <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Perfumer" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Perfumer" target="">Perfumer</a> enemies here. It's up to you if you want to fight them or just run through them. </p> 
                    <p>Exit to the right as you reach the small Golden Tree here, and then head outside. Once you reach the poisonous swamp outside the golden tree, look for the Forager Brood <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Lesser Kindred of Rot (Pests)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Lesser+Kindred+of+Rot+(Pests)" target="">(Lesser Kindred of Rot)</a> along the right cliff edge. You will find it near the Deathbird-infested swamp. Interact with it to receive the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Forager Brood Cookbook (5)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Forager+Brood+Cookbook+(5)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forager Brood Cookbook [5]</a>. Then, head west west and exit through the opening on the wall until you get the Rauh Base flash on your screen. Activate the Site of Grace as you formally enter this new location. <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Taylew's Ruined Forge" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Taylew's+Ruined+Forge" target="">Taylew's Ruined Forge</a> is just northeast of this Site of Grace but the first thing you need to do is to get the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Map: Rauh Ruins" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Map:+Rauh+Ruins" target="">Map: Rauh Ruins</a> so you can navigate easily. You can come back to this grace and explore this dungeon later on.</p> 
                    <p>To get the map, travel southwest where you see 2 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Golem" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golem">Golem</a> Warriors ahead. One is using a bow, while the other one is using an axe. It is recommended to eliminate them before you take the map since they can still attack you from a very long distance. Get rid of the archer first as it's easier to deal with them in close combat. Then, you can take on the other golem warrior. The map is just ahead, next to stone heads past the golem warriors. After acquiring the map, head west and follow the river to the right side to use the Temple Town Ruins - Site of Grace. Then, return to where you picked up the map and look for the sealed spiritspring which gives access to the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Northern Nameless Mausoleum" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Northern+Nameless+Mausoleum" target="">Northern Nameless Mausoleum</a>.</p> 
                    <p>You can find the sealed <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Spiritspring" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Spiritspring">Spiritspring</a> by the base of a sheer cliff to the southeast of where the Rauh Ruins map was found; the corresponding stacks of stones for the Spiritspring can be found to the south of it up a ramp by the side of the cliff [<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Interactive Map?id=655542&amp;code=mapD" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=655542&amp;code=mapD">Elden Ring Map</a>], break it to unlock the Spiritspring. Jump up the Spiritspring to land on a terrace with another Spiritspring, and use it to reach the very top of the plateau where the Mausoleum is.</p> 
                    <p>Just like any other mausoleum in the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+of+the+Erdtree" target="">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> DLC, the location is an arena for a mini-boss encounter against the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Red Bear" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Red+Bear" target="">Red Bear</a>. By the entrance, there is a Summoning Pool or effigy for players to use for co-op. There is also a Stake of Marika that you can use to respawn by the entrance of the mausoleum in case you die. As mentioned, the location is where you'll fight against a mini-boss, so make preparations before you pass through the mist. For guides and strategies on how to defeat the boss, please visit the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Red Bear" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Red+Bear" target="">Red Bear</a> page.</p> 
                    <p>Defeating this mini-boss rewards the player with the following items:</p> 
                    <ul> 
                        <li><a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Iron Rivet Set" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Iron+Rivet+Set" target="">Iron Rivet Set</a></li>

                    </ul> 
                    <p>After defeating the boss, return to the Temple Town Ruins - Site of Grace [<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Interactive Map?id=655313&amp;code=mapD" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=655313&amp;code=mapD">See Elden Ring Map</a>], and follow the river going east. You will be by the ruins area with Shadow Pothead enemies scattered around the ruins. Explore the ruins area, and you'll find x4 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Rada Fruit" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rada+Fruit" target="">Rada Fruit</a> on a dead body on top of a collapsed roof. You can also find x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Revered Spirit Ash" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Revered+Spirit+Ash" target="">Revered Spirit Ash</a> on the southern part of the ruins. Afterwards, you can head west through the archway to find the graveyard section of the ruins. You can pick up x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Grave Glovewort [8]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Grave+Glovewort+[8]" target="">Grave Glovewort [8]</a> on a dead body. A Spiritgrave Stone can also be picked up on the western side of the graveyard, by the gravestones on the corner.</p> 
                    <p>To get inside the ruins' structure, you can find a small opening on the southern part of the wall of the enclosed structure. You will encounter numerous Shadow Undead, Shadow Pothead and Rotten Strays, so be prepared to face numerous enemies. On the southeastern corner of the ruins, you can find x3 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Beast Blood" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Beast+Blood" target="">Beast Blood</a> by a collapsed roof, along with x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Golden Rune [1]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Rune+[1]" target="">Golden Rune [1]</a>. Continue heading north, and you can pick up a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Somber Smithing Stone [3]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone+[3]" target="">Somber Smithing Stone [3]</a> by a wall on the west side beside a Shadow Undead.</p> 
                    <p>Head up the stairs on the east side, then go south to find a Shadow Pothead. Continue heading up the stairs covered by tattered cloth. Go on the northwestern edge of the collapsed roof, then drop down carefully to get to the area under the roof. Once you have successfully dropped down, you'll be in a small room with pots and a Shadow Undead. Go past the archway, and you'll encounter another Shadow Pothead. In this area, you can loot the dead body to obtain a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Scadutree Fragment" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scadutree+Fragment" target="">Scadutree Fragment</a>. Exit the structure through where you dropped earlier, then head northwest.</p> 
                    <p>Traverse through the bridge on the northwestern side, picking up x2 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Furlcalling Finger Remedy" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Furlcalling+Finger+Remedy" target="">Furlcalling Finger Remedy</a> along the way. You will encounter a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Horned Warrior" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Horned+Warrior" target="">Horned Warrior</a> going down the stairs. After defeating the Horned Warrior, go up the stairs where it was coming down from. A structure will be at the top of the stairs containing a chest. Open the chest to find the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Two-Handed Sword Talisman" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Two-Handed+Sword+Talisman" target="">Two-Handed Sword Talisman</a>. When you're done with Temple Town Ruins, you will now head to Rivermouth Cave south of Temple Town Ruins. Go to the edge of the cliff near the mosquito to see tombstones to descend all the way down.</p> 
                    <p>Once you land at the bottom, grab the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Two-Headed Turtle Talisman" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Two-Headed+Turtle+Talisman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Two-Headed Turtle Talisman</a> in the small cave to the left of the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Giant Crab" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Giant+Crab">Giant Crab</a>. Continue navigating southwest and stick to the wall on your right side. You will see the entrance to the cave a few meters from the platform. As you enter, you will immediately discover the Rivermouth Cave Site of Grace [<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Interactive Map?id=655378&amp;code=mapD" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=655378&amp;code=mapD">See Elden Ring Map</a>]. If you go to the cavern going east, you will encounter 4 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Wolf" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Wolf">wolves</a> in an area. In the northeast side of the room, you can pillage a body for x2 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Hefty Beast Bone" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Hefty+Beast+Bone" target="">Hefty Beast Bone</a>.</p> 
                    <p>As you head deeper, the path will fork. The path on the right will have two hostile wolves along with a dead body that you can loot for x3 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Sliver of Meat" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Sliver+of+Meat" target="">Sliver of Meat</a>. This leads to a dead-end, so return to the path and follow the other path. This path will lead you to an area with an upper-level and three wolves.</p> 
                    <p>If you climb up the opening on the east side of the area, you will find a body containing loot. When you get closer to loot the body, the ground will collapse, making you fall. You can then loot the body to pick up a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow Realm Rune (1)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+Realm+Rune+(1)">Shadow Realm Rune [1]</a>. The path going northwest will be a dead-end, so go down the path east. As you are traversing the eastern path, you can gather x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Sanguine Amaryllis" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Sanguine+Amaryllis" target="">Sanguine Amaryllis</a> along the way.</p> 
                    <p>The path will lead you to an area full of Bloodfiends. If you want to go back up, go to the path on your right, and you will encounter a Bloodfiend. After disposing of the enemy, follow the path west going up, in which you will encounter two wolves. Keep following the path, encountering two more wolves along with a dead body that you can loot for x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Sacred Bloody Flesh" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Sacred+Bloody+Flesh" target="">Sacred Bloody Flesh</a>. Keep following the path, which is going north, and you will be back in the area before you fall.</p> 
                    <p>If you wish to continue, you can clear the area by sneaking up on the ogres and backstabbing them. They are also easy to deal with, as you can kill them in around two hits. If you aggro them all at the same time, you can fight one of them at a time by dragging the enemies away from the area. After clearing them, you can gather a few <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Sanguine Amaryllis" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Sanguine+Amaryllis" target="">Sanguine Amaryllis</a> around the edges of the blood pool. On the altar, you can pick up x3 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Sacred Bloody Flesh" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Sacred+Bloody+Flesh" target="">Sacred Bloody Flesh</a>. In the northern corner of the area, near the ramp where you came from, you can pick up x6 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Sanguine Amaryllis" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Sanguine+Amaryllis" target="">Sanguine Amaryllis</a>. There will be a boss fog nearby.</p> 
                    <p>When you enter the boss room, you will be facing the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Chief Bloodfiend" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Chief+Bloodfiend" target="">Chief Bloodfiend</a>. It is a more aggressive version of the Bloodfiends that you encountered earlier. It can jump towards you from afar, while also using its club more effectively than the ones you encountered earlier. For a more in-depth guide on how to defeat the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Chief Bloodfiend" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Chief+Bloodfiend">Chief Bloodfiend</a>, you can go refer to <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Chief Bloodfiend" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Chief+Bloodfiend">this</a> page. Once you have defeated the Chief Bloodfiend, it will drop x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Bloodfiend Hexer's Ashes" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bloodfiend+Hexer's+Ashes" target="">Bloodfiend Hexer's Ashes</a>. You can find the exit on the southeastern side of the room. <span style="color: #b4b2b0;">When you're done here, head back out so you can continue to </span><a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Scorpion River Catacombs" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scorpion+River+Catacombs" target="">Scorpion River Catacombs</a><span style="color: #b4b2b0;">.</span></p> 
                    <p>The <strong>Scorpion River Catacombs</strong> is located on the far western section of Rauh Base. You can get here by traveling west past Temple Town Ruins where you will come across scarlet-inflicted pest enemies. The path here is dangerous because these enemies can stagger you while riding <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Torrent" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Torrent" target="">Torrent</a>. From the Temple Town Ruins - Site of Grace, follow the river heading north and hug the cliff face on your right. Past the red servants of rot, there is a small cave. Inside it, you will find a Shadowpot enemy. Beware of the poison traps littered around. Defeating this enemy drops x3 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Fire Spritestone" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fire+Spritestone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fire Spritestone</a>, and <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Antiquity Scholar's Cookbook (1)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Antiquity+Scholar's+Cookbook+(1)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Antiquity Scholar's Cookbook [1]</a>. From here, continue northwest until you reach the Ravine North - Site of Grace as the river comes to a bend. This is found on an upper section to the right side of the water.</p> 
                    <p>From the site of grace, jump down on the river below you. You will find a Horned Warrior standing in the middle of the water. You can fight it to get its armor, then, stick to the wall on your left side until you see gravestones come into view. As you reach the end here, you will see a door with 2 Ghostflame lanterns. This is your entrance to the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Scorpion River Catacombs" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scorpion+River+Catacombs" target="">Scorpion River Catacombs</a>.</p> 
                    <p>From the Site of Grace, head straight through the catacombs. In the first room, an Imp enemy will ambush you. Afterward, head left down a short set of stairs towards a large hallway, and turn left into a small room. Inside, you'll find a corpse holding x3 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Rejuvenating Boluses" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rejuvenating+Boluses" target="">Rejuvenating Boluses</a> and two Imps guarding it. Take them out.</p> 
                    <p>Exit the small room and cross the bridge in the middle of the large hallway until you find another set of stairs going down. Follow the path until you reach another large room with two Imp enemies inside. Eliminate them and head down the stairs of the large room. Just below the stairs is a corpse holding a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Grave Glovewort (3)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Grave+Glovewort+(3)">Grave Glovewort [3]</a>. Proceed through the tunnel entrance on the same level to find another room with an Imp guarding a plant on the left that gives you <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Yellow Fulgurbloom" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Yellow+Fulgurbloom" target="">Yellow Fulgurbloom</a>. At the other end of the room is another tunnel, but before proceeding, loot the corpse beside the tunnel to get x5 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Redflesh Mushroom" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Redflesh+Mushroom">Redflesh Mushrooms</a>.</p> 
                    <p>Head down the tunnel and go straight through the tight path, turning right towards another short set of stairs going down. Do not immediately exit the tunnel after turning right. There's a large spike trap that launches from above. Wait for the spike to go down, then immediately run to the right to a small space that keeps you safe from the spike trap. From here, you can either run to the right to get out of the spike area or go to the corpse on the other side that has the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ghost Glovewort" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ghost+Glovewort" target="">Ghost Glovewort</a> and then run to safety after looting it.</p> 
                    <p>Once you're out of the spike trap area, turn left and drop down to another level, but be careful, as there are three Basilisks waiting to attack you. After killing the Basilisks, head through the tunnel on this level to find another corpse on the left, giving you the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow Realm Rune (3)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+Realm+Rune+(3)">Shadow Realm Runes [4]</a>. Exit the tunnel, and just to the left, you'll see another <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Yellow Fulgurbloom" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Yellow+Fulgurbloom" target="">Yellow Fulgurbloom</a>.</p> 
                    <p>To the right, you'll find a ladder going up. Head up the ladder and take out an Imp enemy on the edge of the tunnel enjoying the view of the next room. Drop down into the room and loot the corpse on the right for another <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ghost Glovewort [5]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ghost+Glovewort+[5]" target="">Ghost Glovewort [5]</a>.</p> 
                    <p>Then, head to the left side of the room and up a short set of stairs. Turn left to find yourself back at the spike trap area. Cross the spike trap area again, but instead of dropping down to the Basilisk area, turn right. This leads to an open hallway with Messmer Soldiers inside. Before proceeding toward the Messmer Soldiers, run to a safe space on the right as the first half of the hallway is another spike trap. Once you cross the hallway, take out the two Messmer Soldiers and then the Black Knight with its back turned. After clearing the hallway, loot the corpse on the right near where you fought the Messmer Soldiers to get a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithing Stone [5]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+[5]" target="">Smithing Stone [5]</a>. In the middle of the hallway, where the Black Knight stood, loot the altar to receive the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Black Knight Captain Huw" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Black+Knight+Captain+Huw" target="">Black Knight Captain Huw</a>.</p> 
                    <p>Afterward, head back to the safe area of the second spike trap and climb the ladder going up. Once you reach the top, wait for the spike trap to go down. Before it goes back up, hop on top of it to reach a secret platform above. Loot the corpse there to get a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ghost Glovewort [6]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ghost+Glovewort+[6]" target="">Ghost Glovewort [6]</a>. Hop on the spike trap again to go back to the level above the ladder.</p> 
                    <p>Cross the bridge to the right, and before heading straight through the other tunnel, turn left and cross the ledge. Hop on the spike trap that goes down on the left to reach another secret platform and loot a corpse for the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Imp Head (lion)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Imp+Head+(lion)" target="">Imp Head (lion)</a>.</p> 
                    <p>Return to the ledge, but before going back, turn left first to the tunnel here and enter the small room at the end. Kill two Imps guarding a corpse that gives you the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Knight's Lightning Spear" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Knight's+Lightning+Spear" target="">Knight's Lightning Spear</a>. Afterward, head back through the tunnel. Before exiting to the ledge area, turn left and go up the stairs to a small area with two Imps. Loot the corpse on the left to get x6 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Yellow Fulgurbloom" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Yellow+Fulgurbloom" target="">Yellow Fulgurbloom</a>.</p> 
                    <p>Once done looting, drop down near the corpse to find yourself back at the crossing point of the ledge where you crossed the bridge earlier. Go through the tunnel now and take the elevator down. Once you reach the bottom, head straight through the catacomb tunnels until you reach an intersection. Turn right and wait a few seconds for a shadow fireball trap to cross. When the shadow fireball passes and goes back, tail it down a set of stairs. There's climbable rubble up ahead, but first, check if the shadow fireball has crossed. If it has, climb up the rubble and turn right to the first path.</p> 
                    <p>Follow the path until you reach a giant Imp guarding a short set of stairs. Loot the corpse to the right for a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Grave Glovewort [4]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Grave+Glovewort+[4]" target="">Grave Glovewort [4]</a> before taking out the giant Imp. Head down the stairs after defeating the giant Imp and you'll find yourself in another large room. Head straight and loot the corpse and plant for a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Yellow Fulgurbloom" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Yellow+Fulgurbloom" target="">Yellow Fulgurbloom</a> and <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ghost Glovewort [8]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ghost+Glovewort+[8]" target="">Ghost Glovewort [8]</a>. Then, go down the ladder to the right of the plant and corpse. Once you reach the bottom, loot the corpse to the left for a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Great Ghost Glovewort" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Great+Ghost+Glovewort" target="">Great Ghost Glovewort</a>.</p> 
                    <p>Head back up the ladder and turn left through another tunnel, and head up the stairs. At the top, peek first because there are two Shadow Fireballs that will cross. Wait for them to pass above you and then run across the bridge. You can stop in the middle of the bridge and drop down to the left onto a small area to get a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Yellow Fulgurbloom" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Yellow+Fulgurbloom" target="">Yellow Fulgurbloom</a> plant.</p> 
                    <p>At the other end of this place, where you dropped down, is a ladder going up. Climb up to find a small room with some Imps and a chest containing the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ancient Dragon Knight's Cookbook (2)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ancient+Dragon+Knight's+Cookbook+(2)">Ancient Dragon Knight's Cookbook [2]</a>. Afterward, from the ladder, turn left through a tight tunnel that leads to the second level of a previous area. Loot the corpse on the right for x2 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Rejuvenating Boluses" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rejuvenating+Boluses" target="">Rejuvenating Boluses</a>.</p> 
                    <p>Turn left towards another tunnel with a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Yellow Fulgurbloom" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Yellow+Fulgurbloom" target="">Yellow Fulgurbloom</a> plant on the right. To the left of the tunnel is a drop-down path back to where the Shadow Fireball trap of the bridge you dropped down from earlier was. Cross the bridge completely and turn right at the end. There's another elevator here that goes down. At the bottom, walk straight to find a yellow mist that leads to the Death Knight boss battle. This boss drops the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Death Knight's Longhaft Axe" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Death+Knight's+Longhaft+Axe" target="">Death Knight's Longhaft Axe</a> and <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Cerulean Amber Medallion 3" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Cerulean+Amber+Medallion+3">Cerulean Amber Medallion +3</a>. Teleport to the entrance and then head north to the area in front of you.</p> 
                    <p>Follow the path and look at the area to your right side. If it's nighttime, you will spot a small illuminated gravesite here and you can pick up a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Larval Tear" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Larval+Tear" target="">Larval Tear</a> in the center. Then, turn left and scale the edge of this small section and look for an item found on a heap of soil. Interact with it to pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Greater Potentate's Cookbook [8]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Greater+Potentate's+Cookbook+[8]" target="">Greater Potentate's Cookbook [8]</a>. Return to the path and head north and continue past <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Rugalea the Great Red Bear" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rugalea+the+Great+Red+Bear" target="">Rugalea the Great Red Bear</a> here. Turn right as you climb up the higher plain and then pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Highland Warrior Set" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Highland+Warrior+Set" target="">Highland Warrior Set</a>. Then, jump back down and fight the field boss here. Defeating it will give you the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Roar of Rugalea" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Roar+of+Rugalea" target="">Roar of Rugalea</a>. </p> 
                    <p>After clearing the area north of <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Scorpion River Catacombs" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scorpion+River+Catacombs" target="">Scorpion River Catacombs</a>, return to Ancient Ruins Base - Site of Grace and head north. You will quickly happen upon a silver scarab holding a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Somber Smithing Stone [7]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone+[7]" target="">Somber Smithing Stone [7]</a>. Continue on, encountering misbegotten enemies on your path. You will spot another silver scarab, this time hanging on some ruins above a misbegotten, earning you the Scattershot Throw Ash of War. Continue up the hill approaching the dungeon entrance, dealing with more misbegotten. Before entering the dungeon, head around the back of the entrance to the right to find yet another silver scarab sitting upon the structure's northeasternmost column. This one drops a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Somber Smithing Stone [9]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone+[9]" target="">Somber Smithing Stone [9]</a>. Head inside and touch the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Taylew's Ruined Forge" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Taylew's+Ruined+Forge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylew's Ruined Forge</a> site of grace.</p> 
                    <p>To proceed, follow the hallway and find a stone golem. Note that this enemy is resilient to physical attacks and has a lot of health. However, it is rather slow so plan your attacks and stance and break the said golem until it dies. After beating the Stone Golem, get the nearest loot which is the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithscript Axe" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithscript+Axe" target="">Smithscript Axe</a>. Continue progressing in the dungeon by exiting back from where you came from and this time, access the lower parts by jumping into the broken part of the hallway.</p> 
                    <p>Follow the hallway and you will eventually reach a long stone pillar that extends to the lava area underneath you and also extends to the upper part of the area. But first, access the adjacent area from where you are. You will come across another lava slime. Defeat and behind it, there is loot near the broken statue which contains the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithscript Greathammer" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithscript+Greathammer" target="">Smithscript Greathammer</a>. Proceed by heading back to the stone pillar and this time head to the upper area by accessing the upper part of the stone pillar.</p> 
                    <p>You will eventually notice that there are two platforms that you can jump off to. Access the one on the left and you will come to access two Stone Golems. This encounter will be challenging as both so proceed with caution. One thing to note is, that there's a red stone located at the back of these golems and these are the weak spots of these entities. </p> 
                    <p>After defeating both of the golems, head to the nearest balcony where a dead body lies. Loot the body and get an <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ancient+Dragon+Smithing+Stone" target="">Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone</a>. Head back to the area where you fought the two Stone Golem, loot another dead body, and receive x5 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithing Stone [4]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+[4]" target="">Smithing Stone [4]</a>.</p> 
                    <p>To proceed, head back to the stone pillar and use it to get across to the adjacent platform. There are three directions that you can head from here. However, we suggest heading to the lower area by jumping from the platform you are in right now.</p> 
                    <p>You are in the correct area if you landed in Lava Slimes. Follow the hallway and there's a nearby dead body that you can loot. It contains a x3 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithing Stone [8]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+[8]" target="">Smithing Stone [8]</a>. Proceed by heading to the other hallway near the location where a ladder that you can access. Use the ladder to proceed.</p> 
                    <p>After the ladder, you will be greeted with Lava Slimes. Take them out and notice that there's another area or platform where you can jump off too. However, a Lava Slime and another Stone Golem are waiting on the other side.</p> 
                    <p>Take these enemies out and there is another dead body which you can loot. Loot it and get a x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Somber Smithing Stone [3]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone+[3]" target="">Somber Smithing Stone [3]</a>. Head to the other hallway near the ladder and find yourself on another balcony. There's a nearby lever that you can interact with. Pull the lever and notice that the stone pillar will change its position so you can access the other side of the area.</p> 
                    <p>To proceed, notice that there's another chained ironed platform that you can jump off to be able to return and access the pillar. But before heading to the stone pillar, notice that there's another hallway near which leads to a dead end.</p> 
                    <p>There's another dead body that you can loot which contains x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Somber Smithing Stone [8]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone+[8]" target="">Somber Smithing Stone [8]</a>. Head back to the previous hallway and this time, head to the other hallway which leads to a room filled with Stone Golems and Lava Slimes. You are in the right area if you notice the Elite Stone Golem that has some kind of burning ember on its head.</p> 
                    <p>Deal with this enemy first and try to lure it from the pack. Be careful though as it can throw lavas at you by using the said ember. After dealing with all the enemies around this area, notice that there is debris that you can use to reach the upper area. Once you reach the upper area, notice that there's an important item to loot.</p> 
                    <p>Loot the said item and receive a x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithscript Shield" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithscript+Shield" target="">Smithscript Shield</a>. We are about to reach the end of this dungeon and proceed by heading back to the Stone Pillar and you will notice there's another area that you can reach on the left while climbing the stone pillar.</p> 
                    <p>Reach the said area and notice that there's a ladder that you can take to proceed. Do so and you will find an altar near your location. Interact with this Altar and you will receive the following, x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Taylew the Golem Smith" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Taylew+the+Golem+Smith" target="">Taylew the Golem Smith</a> and x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ancient+Dragon+Smithing+Stone" target="">Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone</a>. This is the end of the dungeon exploration. Access the teleporter so you can exit. This was the last dungeon to explore in Rauh Base, and you have one more armament to gather nearby.</p> 
                    <p>You'll see on the map that there's a small pond in the same wooded area. It will be populated by several Bloodfiends. The item they're guarding in the middle of the pond is <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Bloodfiend's Sacred Spear" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bloodfiend's+Sacred+Spear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloodfiend's Sacred Spear</a> [<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Interactive Map?id=659336&amp;code=mapD" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=659336&amp;code=mapD">See it on the Map here</a>] and the talisman nearby. From the pond, head west, and then south at the last bridge support pillar. You will come upon a small camp; a tent, carts, and a few Messmer's soldiers. Deal with the enemies, then break the barrels inside the tent to reveal a chest containing the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Pearl Shield Talisman" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Pearl+Shield+Talisman" target="">Pearl Shield Talisman</a>. Head there to pick up the item. Then, if you have been following this walkthrough, you will now be heading to Shadow Keep to clear the Church District and Scadutree Base. You can teleport to the Church District Highroad - Site of Grace near the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Cathedral of Manus Metyr" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Cathedral+of+Manus+Metyr" target="">Cathedral of Manus Metyr</a>.</p>

                    <p><strong>Shadow Keep acts as a hub for the main story progression and major NPC questlines. You will be coming and going here and the sections are separated into 3, each with different objectives every time you go in</strong>:</p> 
                    <ul> 
                        <li>Shadow Keep (Church District and Scadutree Base): Drain the water to access the lower area. You will progress <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Fire Knight Queelign (NPC)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fire+Knight+Queelign+(NPC)" target="">Fire Knight Queelign (NPC)</a> questline inside, and defeat the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Scadutree Avatar" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scadutree+Avatar" target="">Scadutree Avatar</a>. You will also need to reach the Shadow Keep, Back Gate - Site of Grace in preparation for the Count Ymir and Jolan quests.</li> 
                        <li>Shadow Keep Depths (Recluse River): This is an area that can be accessed through an illusory wall and reveals access to <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Eastern Nameless Mausoleum" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Eastern+Nameless+Mausoleum" target="">Eastern Nameless Mausoleum</a> and <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Darklight Catacombs" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Darklight+Catacombs" target="">Darklight Catacombs</a>. This is also how you will gain entry to the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Abyssal Woods" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Abyssal+Woods" target="">Abyssal Woods</a>. As you discover the secret access here, you will also stop by the area above Main Plaza to take part in the Needle Knight Leda and Hornsent fight.</li> 
                        <li>Shadow Keep (Main): This is the third and final exploration of Shadow Keep and ends with defeating the main boss of this legacy dungeon. This section is also where you will progress Sir Ansbach and Redmane Freyja's quests.</li> 
                    </ul> 
                    <p>From the Church District Highroad - Site of Grace, travel west-northwest towards the keep entrance and look for the pest found above the tunnel road. Follow the western cliff edge and seek the pest near the outer wall of the keep. Interact with it to receive the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Forager Brood Cookbook (6)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Forager+Brood+Cookbook+(6)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forager Brood Cookbook [6]</a>. The main entrance of the Church District of the Shadow Keep is located on the east side of the Shadow Keep. The direct path to finding it is to travel from the Church District High Road Site of Grace [<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree Map?id=655102&amp;code=mapD" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+of+the+Erdtree+Map?id=655102&amp;code=mapD">See Shadow of the Erdtree Map</a>]. You'll know you'll arrive when you enter a large doorway and pass through a long hallway. At the end of the hallway is where you'll formally arrive at the church district and discover the Church District Entrance checkpoint [<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree Map?id=655343&amp;code=mapD" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+of+the+Erdtree+Map?id=655343&amp;code=mapD">See Shadow of the Erdtree Map</a>]. </p> 
                    <p>The Church District is a flooded area, and the goal is to traverse the area by using high ground and finding a mechanism that drains the water. Please take note that falling into the water will result in death. Ignore the path on the left since you won't be able to use the lift until you drain the flood. Instead, jump across (using a running jump) to land on the roof of a building, then check the right side to find a small <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Crab" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Crab" target="">Crab</a> and a body next to it that can be looted to acquire x2 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Crab Eggs" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Crab+Eggs" target="">Crab Eggs</a>. Continue walking around the roof to find another body that's being eaten by a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Crab" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Crab" target="">Crab</a>. Loot the body to obtain x4 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Thin Beast Bones" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Thin+Beast+Bones" target="">Thin Beast Bones</a>. Continue south and you'll find another body being eaten by a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Crab" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Crab" target="">Crab</a>, check the body to find x2 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Strip of White Flesh" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Strip+of+White+Flesh" target="">Strip of White Flesh</a>. </p> 
                    <p>Next, jump on the floating tree trunk to reach a large broken-up circular platform. The path here is fairly straightforward, try to reach the opposite end by using the floating tree trunks and wooden platforms, and make sure to loot the body on the circular platform to find x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Great Grave Glovewort" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Great+Grave+Glovewort" target="">Great Grave Glovewort</a>. Retrace your steps to the rooftop of the building where you looted bodies and killed the small <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Crab" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Crab">Crabs</a>, and this time, head west where you can jump across to progress.</p> 
                    <p>Once you're across, walk around the sides to reach the platform and loot the body that is guarded by Ignited Putrid Corpse enemies to obtain x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Fireproof Pickled Liver" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fireproof+Pickled+Liver" target="">Fireproof Pickled Liver</a>. Jump back onto the sides of this building so you can walk to the top and proceed west where you'll have to do a running jump to safely land on top of another roof of a building. On the roof of the building, you should encounter a Fire Knight enemy walking around. Kill it and then loot the body that's near the spot where the Fire Knight enemy was walking to obtain x3 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ember of Messmer" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ember+of+Messmer" target="">Ember of Messmer</a>. Keep going straight until you reach a wall, then turn around to find a body sitting against one of the roof's structures. Loot it to acquire x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Slumbering Egg" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Slumbering+Egg" target="">Slumbering Egg</a> [<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree Map?id=655472&amp;code=mapD" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+of+the+Erdtree+Map?id=655472&amp;code=mapD">See Shadow of the Erdtree Map</a>].</p> 
                    <p>Next, face the east side of the compass and you should see a narrow ramp structure of one of the churches. Do a running jump to land on it safely, then walk to the top where you'll find two large openings or holes on the big roof. Slowly drop down onto the narrow structure that's on the right side, then you can walk down so you can safely run onto the other structure that is on the left so you can loot the body that holds x3 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Stormhawk Feather" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Stormhawk+Feather">Stormhawk Feathers</a> [<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree Map?id=655473&amp;code=mapD" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+of+the+Erdtree+Map?id=655473&amp;code=mapD">See Shadow of the Erdtree Map</a>]. Go back and then drop down onto the opening of a ceiling.</p> 
                    <p>Below, you should immediately see yet another corpse next to a small <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Crab" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Crab" target="">Crab</a>. Loot the body to find x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Lightningproof Pickled Liver" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Lightningproof+Pickled+Liver" target="">Lightningproof Pickled Liver</a>. Go around, northeast, and you'll locate a locked door, this is the Prayer Room that requires the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Prayer Room Key" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Prayer+Room+Key" target="">Prayer Room Key</a>, a key that drops upon defeating the NPC Invader <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Fire Knight Queelign" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fire+Knight+Queelign" target="">Fire Knight Queelign</a>, encountered for the second time at the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Church of the Crusade" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Church+of+the+Crusade" target="">Church of the Crusade</a> [<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree Map?id=655138&amp;code=mapD" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+of+the+Erdtree+Map?id=655138&amp;code=mapD">See Shadow of the Erdtree Map</a>]. If you have the key, you can unlock the door and find <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Fire Knight Queelign (NPC)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fire+Knight+Queelign+(NPC)" target="">Fire Knight Queelign (NPC)</a> in the flesh. Now, if you have an item called the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Iris of Occultation" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Iris+of+Occultation" target="">Iris of Occultation</a>, you can give it to the NPC, and after Queelign's dialogue, the NPC will drop a weapon you can loot. This weapon is <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Queelign's Greatsword" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Queelign's+Greatsword" target="">Queelign's Greatsword</a>. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>NOTE</strong></span>: If you give the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Iris of Grace" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Iris+of+Grace" target="">Iris of Grace</a> to Queelign, you'll receive the Spirit Ash "<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Fire Knight Queelign" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fire+Knight+Queelign">Fire Knight Queelign</a>". The <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Iris of Occultation" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Iris+of+Occultation" target="">Iris of Occultation</a> can be acquired in many ways, one way is by obtaining it as an item drop from defeating a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Lesser Ulcerated Tree Spirit" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Lesser+Ulcerated+Tree+Spirit" target="">Lesser Ulcerated Tree Spirit</a> located in this area after you drain the flood. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">IMPORTANT</span></strong>: You may only give him one iris, either the Iris of Occultation or the Iris of Grace, to obtain only one reward.</p> 
                    <p>Exit the prayer room and proceed to the northwest doorway, but before proceeding further, be sure to enter the armory room on the left to find a body sitting against the wall. Loot the body to find x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Rune of an Unsung Hero" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rune+of+an+Unsung+Hero" target="">Rune of an Unsung Hero</a><a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Rune Arc" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rune+Arc" target=""><br></a>. Enter the hallway and kill the first <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Fire Knight" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fire+Knight" target="">Fire Knight</a> enemy that you see, on the left side of the hallway, loot the body resting against the wall to find an <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ember of Messmer" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ember+of+Messmer">Ember of Messmer</a> and continue straight down the hallway where you'll encounter another <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Fire Knight" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fire+Knight" target="">Fire Knight</a>. The room ahead is not accessible at the moment and the doorway to the right where you'll notice Marika's statue that has a glowing item in its hand is unreachable, so exit through the first doorway on the left side of the hallway.</p> 
                    <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">NOTE</span>:</strong> In the same hallway, there are two doorways on the left, the far most or second doorway will lead you to a lift that takes you to the <strong>Specimen Storehouse</strong> section of the Shadow Keep. You're free to roam here, but we highly recommend returning to the Specimen Storehouse after clearing the Main Plaza and Church District of the Shadow Keep. What you can do is enter the Specimen Storehouse, and activate the nearby Site of Grace (Storehouse, Back Section) so you can just fast travel here after exploring the Church District. </p> 
                    <p>Cross the pathway where you'll encounter two <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Giant Bat" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Giant+Bat" target="">Giant Bat</a> enemies, then walk up to the short steps where you'll encounter another <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Giant Bat" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Giant+Bat" target="">Giant Bat</a> ahead. Jump over the gap, and kill the creature. Now before going straight, walk up a bit and you'll find a corner on the right. It's a dead end but there's a body that you can loot that's being protected by another <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Giant Bat" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Giant+Bat" target="">Giant Bat</a> hanging from the ceiling. Kill the enemy and loot the body to acquire x3 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Hefty Beast Bone" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Hefty+Beast+Bone" target="">Hefty Beast Bone</a> [<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree Map?id=655477&amp;code=mapD" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+of+the+Erdtree+Map?id=655477&amp;code=mapD">See Shadow of the Erdtree Map</a>]. Next, climb the ladder next to a doorway to find a lever that you can interact with to drain the water and trigger a cutscene.</p> 
                    <p>You can also return to the hallway to get the item sitting on the hand of Marika's statue. You can get the item by jumping on the hand, it may require a few tries as the platform that you need to stand on is quite narrow. Loot the item to acquire x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Scadutree Fragment" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scadutree+Fragment" target="">Scadutree Fragment</a>, then prepare to fight a group of Ignited Putrid Corpse as you jump down. Behind the same statue, you can find the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Fire Knight's Seal" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fire+Knight's+Seal" target="">Fire Knight's Seal</a> weapon [<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree Map?id=655486&amp;code=mapD" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+of+the+Erdtree+Map?id=655486&amp;code=mapD">See Shadow of the Erdtree Map</a>]</p> 
                    <p>For some clarity, we recommend that you start by fast-traveling to the Church District Entrance checkpoint [<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree Map?id=655343&amp;code=mapD" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+of+the+Erdtree+Map?id=655343&amp;code=mapD">See Shadow of the Erdtree Map</a>] since you can now use the lift near the Site of Grace. From the checkpoint, go left, use the lever to call the lift, then step on the center to ride it down. You'll now be able to explore the open area of the Sunken Chapel. At the center, you will see a large tree, only approach the tree if you're prepared to fight because a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Lesser Ulcerated Tree Spirit" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Lesser+Ulcerated+Tree+Spirit" target="">Lesser Ulcerated Tree Spirit</a> will emerge beneath the ground. Killing it will drop the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Mantle of Thorns" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Mantle+of+Thorns" target="">Mantle of Thorns</a>, and resting against the tree is a corpse holding x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Somber Smithing Stone [5]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone+[5]" target="">Somber Smithing Stone [5]</a>.</p> 
                    <p>The second <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Lesser Ulcerated Tree Spirit" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Lesser+Ulcerated+Tree+Spirit" target="">Lesser Ulcerated Tree Spirit</a> is located around the east area of the sunken chapel. Defeating it will drop x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Iris of Occultation" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Iris+of+Occultation" target="">Iris of Occultation</a> which (if you don't have it yet) you can give to Fire Knight Queelign in the Prayer Room to obtain <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Queelign's Greatsword" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Queelign's+Greatsword" target="">Queelign's Greatsword</a>. Also in the east area, you can find open buildings. One building houses two bodies that you can loot to find x4 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithing Stone [4]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+[4]" target="">Smithing Stone [4]</a> and x6 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Kukri" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Kukri" target="">Kukri</a> [<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree Map?id=655479&amp;code=mapD" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+of+the+Erdtree+Map?id=655479&amp;code=mapD">See Shadow of the Erdtree Map</a>].</p> 
                    <p>There is also building another where you'll find a pack of <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Crab" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Crab">Crabs</a> and <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Giant Crab" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Giant+Crab" target="">Giant Crab</a> enemies, one roaming around, and the other next to another body that you can loot to find x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow Realm Rune (5)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+Realm+Rune+(5)">Shadow Realm Rune [5]</a>. [<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree Map?id=655480&amp;code=mapD" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+of+the+Erdtree+Map?id=655480&amp;code=mapD">See Shadow of the Erdtree Map</a>]. If you continue to go around this area, you'll reach the west side where you'll find the Sunken Chapel Site of Grace [<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree Map?id=655344&amp;code=mapD" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+of+the+Erdtree+Map?id=655344&amp;code=mapD">See Shadow of the Erdtree Map</a>]</p> 
                    <p>Head north towards the entrance of the main church then immediately turn left to find a corpse by a corner. Loot the body to find x3 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow Sunflower" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+Sunflower" target="">Shadow Sunflower</a>. Clear out the enemies then approach the small room that has Marika's statue (the same statue where you got the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Scadutree Fragment" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scadutree+Fragment" target="">Scadutree Fragment</a> and the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Fire Knight's Seal" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fire+Knight's+Seal" target="">Fire Knight's Seal</a> weapon. Make a right and you'll enter a large room. Straight ahead, you'll see some stairs on both ends, walk up to the upper platform and investigate the railings to discover a body hanging on top of it.</p> 
                    <p>Loot the body to obtain the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Battlefield Priest's Cookbook (1)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Battlefield+Priest's+Cookbook+(1)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Battlefield Priest's Cookbook [1]</a>, [<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree Map?id=655488&amp;code=mapD" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+of+the+Erdtree+Map?id=655488&amp;code=mapD">See Shadow of the Erdtree Map</a>]. Walk back down the stairs and check under the upper platform to find a door. Open that door and you'll find another lift that takes you underground. Ride it to find and activate the Tree-Worship Passage - Site of Grace.</p> 
                    <p>Proceed to the tunnel straight ahead and activate the effigy on your right. On the exit, you will see a wooden bridge connecting the two areas. Cross to the other side and walk towards the altar. Pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Iris of Grace" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Iris+of+Grace" target="">Iris of Grace</a> right at the foot of the statue. Go down the stairs to the left while facing the statue and then activate the site of grace before exiting this room.</p> 
                    <p>If you head to the outdoor area, you will be fighting the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Scadutree Avatar" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scadutree+Avatar" target="">Scadutree Avatar</a> here. Please see the boss page to know more about how to defeat it. Upon defeating the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Scadutree Avatar" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scadutree+Avatar" target="">Scadutree Avatar</a>, you will receive the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Remembrance of the Shadow Sunflower" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Remembrance+of+the+Shadow+Sunflower" target="">Remembrance of the Shadow Sunflower</a> along with <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Miquella's Great Rune" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Miquella's+Great+Rune" target="">Miquella's Great Rune</a>. From here, (if you followed the tip earlier by activating the Storehouse, Back Section checkpoint in the Specimen Storehouse) you can fast travel to the Storehouse, Back Section Site of Grace to start exploring the Back Section of the Specimen Storehouse.</p> 
                    <p>Upon entering, look to the right immediately to see a noble corpse against the wall. Loot it to obtain x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Somber Smithing Stone [9]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone+[9]" target="">Somber Smithing Stone [9]</a>. Proceed to the left side, through the doorway, where you'll find the Storehouse, Back Section checkpoint. Continue moving straight until you walk past a ladder. Do not climb the ladder first, instead, keep going straight to find some items. First, look to your left to see another noble corpse sitting against a desk, loot it to obtain x3 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Glintslab Firefly" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Glintslab+Firefly" target="">Glintslab Firefly</a>. Then at the end, you'll see a Fire Knight and three Shadow Undead standing next to another corpse, kill the enemies then loot the body to acquire x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Carian Thrusting Shield" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Carian+Thrusting+Shield" target="">Carian Thrusting Shield</a>. </p> 
                    <p>Go back and climb the ladder to the top where you'll encounter another Fire Knight and two Shadow Undead reading a book. You can sneak behind the enemies to backstab them. Continue to the right side and walk carefully up the stairs to avoid aggravating the Fire Knight, roaming the floor above. At the top of the stairs, turn to the corner on the right to find a corpse to loot x3 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Fire Coil" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fire+Coil" target="">Fire Coil</a>. Kill the enemies on this floor, then continue moving straight. You'll discover another noble corpse sitting against a small table, loot it to obtain <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ghost Glovewort (3)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ghost+Glovewort+(3)">Ghost Glovewort (3)</a>, and go straight towards the balcony to find another noble corpse that holds the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Fire Serpent" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fire+Serpent" target="">Fire Serpent</a> incantation. Go back, and look behind the bookcase to find an opening on the wall.</p> 
                    <p>Through the opening, turn right and you'll find another noble corpse sitting by the edge of the narrow scaffolding. Loot the body to acquire x6 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow Sunflower" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+Sunflower" target="">Shadow Sunflower</a>. Continue going up, and by the ramp, you should find another noble corpse that you can loot to obtain x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Blessed Bone Shard" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Blessed+Bone+Shard" target="">Blessed Bone Shard</a>. Continue going up and you'll arrive at the loft section of the storehouse. Activate the Storehouse, Loft Site of Grace before you proceed to explore.</p> 
                    <p>Once you have activated the Storehouse, Loft Site of Grace, proceed to the lift north of the Site of Grace to go up. You will end up on beams above the Specimen Storehouse. This level will be filled with Giant Bats roaming the area. The only path you can follow will be the one going west, so keep following it. There will be a lot of ways you can walk on the beams, but the only way you can progress through this area is through the ladder. Pick up x7 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Thin Beast Bones" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Thin+Beast+Bones" target="">Thin Beast Bones</a> from a body at the edge of a beam, then go up the ladder that you walked past just before picking up the loot.</p> 
                    <p>After climbing the ladder, you will arrive in a new level. If you go to the southeast section of the level, you can find x4 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithing Stone [7]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+[7]" target="">Smithing Stone [7]</a> from a dead body. Following the path from the south side will lead you to a pillar blocking your way. If you look down, you can find a platform that you can jump off of, and it will contain the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Wrath from Afar" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Wrath+from+Afar" target="">Wrath from Afar</a> incantation. Next, jump on the beam to the north, then climb up the nearby ladder to the west of where you landed. You will end up on the beam that a pillar was blocking earlier. You can aggro the bats here, so be careful when attacking as you might fall off of the beams.</p> 
                    <p>You can find a lift in the middle of the beam going west with an item above it, along with a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Fire Knight" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fire+Knight" target="">Fire Knight</a> on a nearby beam which will be hostile if you approach the lift.</p> 
                    <p>If you use the lift to go down, you will end up in an area with a Fire Knight facing the other way around. You can easily dispose of the Fire Knight by backstabbing it and staggering it continuously. After dealing with the Fire Knight, you can pick up x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Rune of an Unsung Hero" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rune+of+an+Unsung+Hero" target="">Rune of an Unsung Hero</a> on the southwestern corner of the area. The area will be clear, and you can head back up the beams using the lift. If you want to get the item above, you can ride the lift, then exit it before going down. A second lift will arrive just beside it, then do it again. Jump on the roof of the first lift just as it is arriving, and you will be able to reach the item, which is a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Fire Knight Hilde" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fire+Knight+Hilde" target="">Fire Knight Hilde</a> summon.</p> 
                    <p>If you walk across the beam going west, you can climb down a ladder. On your left, just around the corner, you can loot a body for a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Somber Smithing Stone (8)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone+(8)">Somber Smithing Stone (8)</a>. Directly northeast of the ladder you descended on, you will find another ladder you can use to descend. You will reach an area similar to the Site of Grace.</p> 
                    <p style="text-align: left;">If you head outside the archway on the northwestern side of the area, you will find a lift directly on your right. Take the lift going down, then keep following the scaffolding until you reach an area with a door and a lift. You cannot open the door yet, so use the lift nearby to go down. The lift will then lead you to the Shadow Keep, Back Gate Site of Grace [<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Interactive Map?id=655352&amp;code=mapD" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=655352&amp;code=mapD">See Elden Ring Map</a>].</p> 
                    <p style="text-align: left;">This area leads you into two areas. There is a room on the east, just beside the Site of Grace. In this room, you can pick up x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Scadutree Fragment" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scadutree+Fragment" target="">Scadutree Fragment</a>. After that, you will see an archway heading outside on the north-northeast side of the room. This is a boss area in which you will be fighting <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Commander Gaius" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Commander+Gaius" target="">Commander Gaius</a> and explore the area behind him. To minimize backtracking, we don't recommend on fighting him now. You will come back here later after you have progressed some NPC questlines related to Scaduview so you can continuously roam here.</p> 
                    <p style="text-align: left;">If you want to keep following this guide, you will return to Castle Front - Site of Grace, in front of Castle Ensis. You will travel through the river and head to the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Southern Shore" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Southern+Shore" target="">Southern Shore</a> to discover the path to <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring St. Trina" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/St.+Trina" target="">St. Trina</a> now that the rune sealing her location has been broken.</p>

                <div class="col-sm-8"> 
                    <p>Teleport to Castle Front - Site of Grace (this is in front of <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Castle Ensis" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Castle+Ensis" target="">Castle Ensis</a>). Face south, then turn left on the first dirt path. Stay on this path continuing east until a small encampment among the trees on your left comes into view. Head towards them and continue east to the cliff edge. Looking over the edge you will see a rock path to follow down towards a group of <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Giant Bat" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Giant+Bat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giant Bats</a>. Continue dropping down the rock path until you're near the small swamp with multiple crabs and  <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Miranda Sprout" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Miranda+Sprout" target="">Miranda Sprout</a> (flower) enemies.</p> 
                    <p>Moving south towards the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Giant Miranda Sprout" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Giant+Miranda+Sprout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giant Miranda Sprout</a>, you will see a narrow entryway to proceed through the cliff. Once inside the cave, continue southwest until you reach an altar with a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Revered Spirit Ash" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Revered+Spirit+Ash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revered Spirit Ash</a>. In the next room, activate the Ellac River Cave - Site of Grace before proceeding so you have a checkpoint. Next, head outside to the south near the waterfall and make your way down the rock pillars. Be careful here as it is easy to fall off, resulting in an instant death. On your way down you will find a body with <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Greater Potentate's Cookbook (12)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Greater+Potentate's+Cookbook+(12)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Greater Potentate's Cookbook [12]</a> on top of one of the rocks. </p> 
                    <p>Once you reach the lower level, as you head south, you will find three <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Gravebird" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Gravebird" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravebird</a> enemies on top of pillars and a body containing x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Somber Smithing Stone (4)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone+(4)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Somber Smithing Stone [4]</a>.  Defeat these enemies or ride through them with <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Torrent" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Torrent" target="">Torrent</a>. Continuing forward, you will see another stone path leading down to the next area. As you reach the lower area, you can activate another Site of Grace, the Ellac River Downstream. </p> 
                    <p>Continue heading south and jump down the rocks on the right side. As you reach the lower level, you will see a giant stone slab on your left that can be used as a bridge. While crossing the stone, look left towards a rock pillar to find a pot hanging from a rope containing the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Mushroom-Seller's Bell Bearing %282%29" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Mushroom-Seller's+Bell+Bearing+%282%29">Mushroom-Seller's Bell Bearing [2]</a>. Move down the stone bridge into the stream to collect the bell bearing and then continue riding south. As the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Furnace Golem" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Furnace+Golem" target="">Furnace Golem</a> comes into view, move to the right of the stream and hug the rock wall. It's up to you if you want to fight this Furnace Golem, but we recommend on getting the Site of Grace first, then backtrack here to fight it later. Continue forward until you come across a large opening in the wall. Go through it and you will enter an area with blue flowers. You can now activate the Cerulean Coast - Site of Grace directly ahead of you. Then, you can backtrack to the location where you saw the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Furnace Golem" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Furnace+Golem" target="">Furnace Golem</a>. East from the Golem you will find lightning rams surrounding a pond with a body containing the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Lightning Perfume Bottle" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Lightning+Perfume+Bottle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lightning Perfume Bottle</a>.  Directly north from here, you will also locate a Forager Brood near the cliff edge. Interact with the pest to receive the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Forager Brood Cookbook (3)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Forager+Brood+Cookbook+(3)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forager Brood Cookbook [3]</a>. This should be the final book. Verify you have collected all 7 Forager Brood Cookbooks and return to Moore at the Main Gate Cross - Site of Grace to advance his questline. Visit the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Moore" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Moore" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moore</a> NPC page for help with any dialogue decisions. </p> 
                    <p>Return to the Cerulean Coast - Site of Grace. Your first stop here is obtaining the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Map: Southern Shore" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Map:+Southern+Shore" target="">Map: Southern Shore</a>. Head south and go past the 3 small patches of land. A Ghostflame Dragon will come swooping down here but you can just outrun it if you don't want to fight it. Head south and go past the glowing worm creatures. You will spot the map to your right just as you reach the top of the hill.</p> 
                    <p>After obtaining the map, continue up the hill then make a left to travel southeast. You will reach Miquella's Cross here next to a Site of Grace. Pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Scadutree Fragment" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scadutree+Fragment" target="">Scadutree Fragment</a> and interact with the Cerulean Coast - Site of Grace. This time, travel west and stick to the cliff on your left. Go past the glowing worm-like creatures and at the very end, a giant <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Troll" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Troll" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Troll</a> enemy will throw boulders at you here. Defeat the Troll to receive x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Hefty Cracked Pot" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Hefty+Cracked+Pot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hefty Cracked Pot</a> and continue traveling south until you reach a large opening in the ground. Before dropping, head east to the top of the cliff to find a body with <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring St. Trina Disciple's Cookbook (2)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/St.+Trina+Disciple's+Cookbook+(2)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">St. Trina Disciple's Cookbook [2]</a>. Return to the large opening and carefully navigate to the bottom by jumping down the rock path.</p> 
                    <p>You can minimize fall damage by riding Torrent as you go down and at the bottom, you will reach The Fissure - Site of Grace. Head east through the tunnel to reach the Stone Coffin Fissure - Site of Grace.</p> 
                    <p>To begin exploring the Stone Coffin Fissure, from the Site of Grace, head south and jump between the platforms until you see an enemy slime on the ground. Go past it and climb the ramp behind it and pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Congealed Putrescence" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Congealed+Putrescence" target="">Congealed Putrescence</a> at the edge.</p> 
                    <p>Then, face the north direction and jump down in this thick pillar ahead of you. Make a right and take x10 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring St. Trina's Arrow" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/St.+Trina's+Arrow" target="">St. Trina's Arrow</a> from the corpse on the ground. Make a U-turn and watch out for a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Bloodfiend" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bloodfiend" target="">Bloodfiend</a> here as you go down. It will come from the edge of the pillar. You can eliminate this enemy or just run away from it.</p> 
                    <p>On the edge of this area, you will see this floor at the cliff. This is a collapsing ground and you can stand on it so you can reach the lower level. There are multiple bloodfiends here and you can eliminate them for a chance to get their items like <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Bloodfiend's Fork" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bloodfiend's+Fork" target="">Bloodfiend's Fork</a>, <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring String" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/String" target="">String</a>, or Runes. Head north towards the cliff where you see a corpse on the ground. Pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Deep-Purple Lily" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Deep-Purple+Lily" target="">Deep-Purple Lily</a> from this corpse. Then, face the southeast and find the way to the center of the dungeon. You will see 2 more Cursed Bloodfiends here sitting on the upper deck. Go towards them and defeat them. You can pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow Realm Rune (3)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+Realm+Rune+(3)">Shadow Realm Rune [3]</a> behind them. </p> 
                    <p>Moving east, you find Miquella's Cross and a Site of Grace. Pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Scadutree Fragment" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scadutree+Fragment" target="">Scadutree Fragment</a> and be sure to activate the Fissure Cross - Site of Grace. From here, face northwest where you see a large chunk of collapsed stone. Looking over the edge of the cliff here, you will find a platform allowing you to drop down to a lower section.</p> 
                    <p>After dropping, face east and head to the bottom level. Straight ahead, you can pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Velvet Sword of St. Trina" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Velvet+Sword+of+St.+Trina" target="">Velvet Sword of St. Trina</a> tucked away at the end of this short cave. Beware of the slimes that will fall from the ceiling. Now take the southern tunnel, exiting to a single Gravebird. Deal with the enemy and pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Nectarblood Burgeon" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Nectarblood+Burgeon" target="">Nectarblood Burgeon</a> from where it was sitting. Drop down and you will find a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Grave Glovewort" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Grave+Glovewort" target="">Grave Glovewort [3]</a> nearby.</p> 
                    <p>Face north and go up the path until you reach another Gravebird. Looking southwest you will see another enemy on top of a stone structure. Moving up, you can collect a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Grave Glovewort (2)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Grave+Glovewort+(2)">Grave Glovewort [2]</a> from a corpse. Moving down to the north you will find <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Abnormal Stone Cluster" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Abnormal+Stone+Cluster" target="">Abnormal Stone Cluster</a> enemies along your path. Be careful here as they will shoot out laser-like projectiles. You can try to move past these enemies or clear them out so it's safer to navigate later on.</p> 
                    <p>Continue forward to the toppled buildings on the other side. To the west, you'll find more stone cluster enemies surrounding a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Grave Glovewort (8)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Grave+Glovewort+(8)">Grave Glovewort [8]</a>. Return to the toppled buildings and follow the path up to the east. Be careful of the Graverbird and Abnormal Stone Cluster enemies here. Once you've dealt with them, jump down on the left side to pick up <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Nectarblood Burgeon" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Nectarblood+Burgeon" target="">Nectarblood Burgeon</a> and x2 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithing Stone" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone" target="">Smithing Stone [6]</a>.</p> 
                    <p>To continue your progress, face northeast where you see another <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Abnormal Stone Cluster" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Abnormal+Stone+Cluster" target="">Abnormal Stone Cluster</a> enemy. Ideally, you want to get rid of this so it will not bother you later. Then, jump down behind the Abnormal Stone Cluster, and jump past another group of cluster enemies. When you see this Site of Grace come into view, go to the right side first. Pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Grave Glovewort (7)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Grave+Glovewort+(7)">Grave Glovewort [7]</a> from a corpse on the edge. Activate the next Site of Grace. While facing northeast, jump to the other platform and then jump down to the lower level.</p> 
                    <p>Cross the bridge and pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Mass of Putrescence" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Mass+of+Putrescence" target="">Mass of Putrescence</a> on the other side. To continue your progress, face northeast and go up the ramp. Watch out for the fire-throwing enemies. When you get to the upper area, you can pick up <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Nectarblood Burgeon" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Nectarblood+Burgeon" target="">Nectarblood Burgeon</a> and <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Congealed Putrescence" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Congealed+Putrescence" target="">Congealed Putrescence</a>.  You can just ignore these enemies after getting the item and continue going up the ramp. At the top, you will find an archway next to a Skeleton Archer. </p> 
                    <p>Jump down the archway but watch out for the giant slime here. Take the path to your left and you will be fighting the spirit of the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Misbegotten Crusader" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Misbegotten+Crusader" target="">Misbegotten Crusader</a>. It will drop the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Multilayered Ring of Light" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Multilayered+Ring+of+Light" target="">Multilayered Ring of Light</a> upon defeating it. Then, jump on the platform to the southeast and cross the bridge to your left. You can pick up 3 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Nectarblood Burgeon" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Nectarblood+Burgeon" target="">Nectarblood Burgeon</a> here. Then, face southeast and follow the faint glimmer of the Site of Grace. Activate it and walk up the ramp.</p> 
                    <p>Go towards the horned statue and jump down. At the bottom, you will reach a boss arena. You will be fighting the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Putrescent Knight" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Putrescent+Knight" target="">Putrescent Knight</a> here, a skeleton riding a horse. It wields a massive weapon that behaves like a boomerang and can be thrown in an arc projectile. This boss can deal a good amount of damage and you can check out our Putrescent Knight page to see more info on how to defeat this boss. This boss will drop <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Remembrance of Putrescence" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Remembrance+of+Putrescence" target="">Remembrance of Putrescence</a> upon defeating it.</p> 
                    <p>A new Site of Grace will be revealed after the fight and it will also unlock the entrance to the Garden of Deep Purple. Go inside the cave and pick up the items inside. There are <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Nectarblood Burgeon" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Nectarblood+Burgeon" target="">Nectarblood Burgeons</a> on the ground and a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring St. Trina Disciple's Cookbook (3)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/St.+Trina+Disciple's+Cookbook+(3)">St. Trina Disciple's Cookbook [3]</a> here. Talk to <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring St. Trina" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/St.+Trina" target="">St. Trina</a> by interacting with the bright purple flower here. This marks the beginning of <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Thiollier" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Thiollier">Thiollier's</a> quest which requires you to return to Pillar Path Cross - Site of Grace and speak with him there. You can also view <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Thiollier" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Thiollier" target="">Thiollier</a> and <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring St. Trina" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/St.+Trina">St. Trina's</a> page to know more about their questline. For now, you are done in this dungeon and you will return to Cerulean Coast - Site of Grace to continue exploring this region.</p> 
                    <p>From the Cerulean Coast - Site of Grace, Head west-southwest towards the edge of a cliff and near a withered tree. Leaning against the tree is a corpse containing <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Grave Keeper's Cookbook (1)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Grave+Keeper's+Cookbook+(1)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grave Keeper's Cookbook [1]</a>. From there, go northwest to a slightly lower area and past a few trees until you find the Cerulean Coast West - Site of Grace. Starting at the Site of Grace, head northeast around the fallen structure, and through the large opening in the cliff. As you approach the large gravestone ahead, you will find a strong demi-human enemy wielding a<a title="Elden Ring Star-Lined Sword" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Star-Lined+Sword" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Star-Lined</a><a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Star-Lined Sword" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Star-Lined+Sword" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Sword</a>. Defeating this enemy will drop x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring starlight shards" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/starlight+shards" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">starlight shards</a>. After defeating this enemy, head east past a few blue worms until you reach a cluster of gravestones surrounded by demi-humans. At the base of the tall gravestone, you will find the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Spirit Sword" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Spirit+Sword" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spirit Sword</a> weapon.</p> 
                    <p>Return to the large gravestone where you fought the demi-human with the Star-Lined Sword. This time, head northwest, hugging the cliff on your left. After a short distance, you will come across a small cave to your right. Inside is a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Scadutree Fragment" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scadutree+Fragment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scadutree Fragment</a> protected by a lesser demi-human chief. Continue following the path northwest where you will soon reach a summoning pool and a Stake of Marika. Over this hill, you'll find <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Demi-Human Queen Marigga" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Demi-Human+Queen+Marigga" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Demi-Human Queen Marigga</a>, an optional field boss surrounded by multiple demi-human enemies. You may use Torrent during this fight, and upon defeat, you will receive the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Star-Lined Sword" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Star-Lined+Sword" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Star-Lined Sword</a>. At the top of the structure behind Demi-Human Queen Marigga, you can pick up a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Great Grave Glovewort" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Great+Grave+Glovewort" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Great Grave Glovewort</a>. You are now finished with this area and can return to the Cerulean Coast West - Site of Grace.</p> 
                    <p>From the grace, head southeast towards the withered tree from earlier, as you approach you will notice a narrow path to your right leading below the tree to a hole you can drop to enter a cave. When you reach the bottom, going east will lead you past multiple <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Blue Worm" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Blue+Worm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blue Worm</a> enemies, and eventually, you will exit to a stone structure with a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Great Grave Glovewort" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Great+Grave+Glovewort" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Great Grave Glovewort</a> on the altar in front of you. Backtrack into the tunnel and continue west until you exit the cave. You can ride your mount while in the tunnel to avoid the fight with the Giant Crayfish.</p> 
                    <p>As you exit, you should find yourself on the small island across from the withered tree. Looking up to your southeast you will see the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Southern Nameless Mausoleum" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Southern+Nameless+Mausoleum" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Southern Nameless Mausoleum</a> behind a few Blue Worms. This is where you will fight Dancer of Ranah. Before proceeding to this boss fight, move left around the rock behind you and follow the path up the rocks. At the top, you will find a corpse containing the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Perfumed Oil of Ranah" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Perfumed+Oil+of+Ranah" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Perfumed Oil of Ranah</a> tool. From here, drop down or jump across and make your way toward the mausoleum. </p>

                    <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>NOTE</strong></span>: If you have been following this walkthrough, you would have unlocked Dragon's Pit - Site of Grace. All you need to do is teleport there and skip the bullet guide on how to reach Dragon's Pit. If you haven't unlocked Dragon's Pit, read below:</p> 
                    <ul> 
                        <li>Teleport to Castle Front - Site of Grace</li> 
                        <li>Head southeast and follow the dirt path</li> 
                        <li>Go past the small army camp here</li> 
                        <li>If this is your first time in the area, make sure to speak with <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Igon" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Igon" target="">Igon</a>, the screaming man lying on the path</li> 
                        <li>Stay on the dirt path (you may encounter a hostile NPC called Ancient Dragon-Man here)</li> 
                        <li>Continue following this path and you will see Dragon's Pit Entrance on the left side marked by lit torches</li> 
                    </ul> 
                    <p>Its entrance is a tight cave marked by torches outside. Once you enter the cave, you can use the Dragon's Pit - Site of Grace. Continuing through the cave, you will enter a more spacious part that resembles a ritual room. There are skeleton enemies here that you need to take out. Afterward, loot the corpse at the back of the ritual area inside a mini cave to obtain a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithing Stone [1]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+[1]" target="">Smithing Stone [1]</a>.</p> 
                    <p>Exit the mini cave and turn left, following another tight path until you reach a cliff with a ledge path to the left. Follow the ledge and drop onto the platform below where a skeleton enemy is waiting. After defeating the enemy, go to the altar on the left and loot the corpse to find the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow Realm Rune (2)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+Realm+Rune+(2)">Shadow Realm Rune [2]</a>.</p> 
                    <p>Turn left from the altar and navigate another tight part of the cave until you enter a room with multiple skeleton enemies and a staircase leading up. Clear the area, then head up the staircase to find a corpse on the left holding x4 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Knot Resin" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Knot+Resin" target="">Knot Resin</a>. On the right, you will encounter a Lesser Magma Wyrm.

                    <p>Return to the staircase and head downstairs until you see another tight part of the cave. After passing through, you will enter a larger section with small structures and torches. Proceed straight ahead and drop down the cliff. Though it’s a long fall, it won't kill you. Upon landing, you will immediately see a yellow mist indicating a boss ahead. Before proceeding through the mist, look back to find a corpse holding x2 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithing Stone [4]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+[4]" target="">Smithing Stone [4]</a>. The boss in this area is the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ancient Dragon-Man" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ancient+Dragon-Man" target="">Ancient Dragon-Man</a>.

Loot the boss and proceed through this door to reach the Dragon's Pit Terminus Site of Grace, which is also the path leading to the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Jagged Peak" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Jagged+Peak" target="">Jagged Peak</a> Region where all the dragons reside. This indicates that defeating the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ancient Dragon-Man" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ancient+Dragon-Man" target="">Ancient Dragon-Man</a> unlocks the path to the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Jagged Peak" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Jagged+Peak" target="">Jagged Peak</a> Region.</p> 
                    <p>From the Dragon's Pit Terminus - Site of Grace, head towards the east where you will encounter Jagged Peak Drake, this is a dragon resting in the middle of the open ground. It's up to you if you want to fight this dragon but you can just skip it and head west so you can avoid it. If you decide to fight it, the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Jagged Peak Drake" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Jagged+Peak+Drake" target="">Jagged Peak Drake</a> can breathe fire and stomp you with its massive legs and wings.

Then, head towards the south where the path narrows. You will encounter skeletons and some fire-breathing enemies here. After a while, you will reach an open area with a broken tower to the right. Inside the tower is a corpse containing <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Igon's Cookbook (1)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Igon's+Cookbook+(1)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Igon's Cookbook [1]</a>.

Make sure to exhaust all her dialogue here before leaving. This is your last stop before heading to Charo's Hidden Grave.</p> 
                    <p>From the Priestess, head southwest up the dragon's body. Climb to the top and then drop down to the red flowers below.

                    <p>At the Lamenter's Gaol - Site of Grace [<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Interactive Map?id=655309&amp;code=mapD" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=655309&amp;code=mapD">See Elden Ring Map</a>], keep following the path going southeast until you arrive near a locked gate. Before the locked gate, there will be an opening on the left side of the wall. Go through the path on your left, then keep following the path. You'll find two rooms with an open gate on the right side as you are traversing the path. The first room will only contain a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Putrid Corpse" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Putrid+Corpse" target="">Putrid Corpse</a>. In the second room, you will encounter two Putrid Corpses. After dealing with the enemies in this room, open the chest to receive x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Gaol Upper Level Key" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Gaol+Upper+Level+Key" target="">Gaol Upper Level Key</a>, which will be used to open the locked gate that you encountered earlier. Return to the path then keep following it until you cross a bridge. Enter the room across the bridge, in which you will encounter a Living Jar along with a Putrid Corpse. The room will be filled with numerous cages. On the northern side of the room, you'll find another room with three cages. On a dead body by the middle cage, you can pick up x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Prattling Pate Lamentation" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Prattling+Pate+Lamentation" target="">Prattling Pate Lamentation</a>.</p> 
                    <p>Open the locked gate to get inside a room with a ladder and x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Frozen Maggot" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Frozen+Maggot" target="">Frozen Maggot</a> that you can pick up. Climb down the ladder, and you will arrive in an area covered in ice. Living Jars will be running around the place, which you can easily deal with as they die in a few hits. You can also pick up numerous Frozen Maggots in the area, as they are scattered all around the area.</p> 
                    <p>There are four rooms in the area that you can enter. In the room closest to the entrance, on the eastern side, you can pick up x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Chilling Perfume Bottle" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Chilling+Perfume+Bottle" target="">Chilling Perfume Bottle</a>. The second room will be the initially closed, but you can open the gate without any key. The room will contain a ladder going down, which will be useful later on. The third room will be the only room that is located a bit higher than the other rooms, requiring you to make a few small jumps. Lastly, in the northernmost room, you will find Living Jars around the room along with a locked gate on the northwestern corner of the room. There will also be a hole near the entrance that leads to loot.</p> 
                    <p>Near the entrance of the third room, you will encounter a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Living Jar" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Living+Jar" target="">Living Jar</a> along with a Putrid Corpse patrolling the nearby room. Head inside the area that seems to be a jail area, onto another room on the eastern side. The cells couldn't be opened, so keep heading east. In the second room, the floor will collapse, making you fall into an area in which you will be surrounded by Putrid Corpses.</p> 
                    <p>Go through the doorway, then keep following the path. You'll see a Putrid Corpse sitting on a cliff along the way. Head up the stairs to proceed further into Lamenter's Gaol. In the middle of the stairs, there will be a room on its landing. Enter the room then keep following its path, leading you to a room containing two Putrid Corpses and a dead body that you can loot for x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Call of Tibia" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Call+of+Tibia" target="">Call of Tibia</a>. Head back out the room, then continue walking up the stairs. There will be another landing with a Putrid Corpse hiding behind the corner. A room will be on the northern side of the landing. The room leads to an area overlooking the room filled with Living Jars.</p> 
                    <p>Go down the slope, then defeat all the Living Jars in the area to freely explore it. On a structure made out of piled up remains, you can pick up x6 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Living Jar Shard" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Living+Jar+Shard" target="">Living Jar Shard</a> on top of it. You can follow a path going southwest of the room, revealing just how big the whole area is. You can pick up x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Hefty Cracked Pot" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Hefty+Cracked+Pot" target="">Hefty Cracked Pot</a> from a body on the southwestern corner of the area. A chest will be in the middle of the southwestern section part of the room, and you can acquire the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Gaol Lower Level Key" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Gaol+Lower+Level+Key" target="">Gaol Lower Level Key</a> when opening it. After acquiring the key, return to the stairs, then keep going up.</p> 
                    <p>When you get to the top of the stairs, enter the room. A Living Jar is hiding on the left side which can attack you by surprise if you aren't aware of it. Keep following the path, going through the doorway on the west side. If you jump down to the room, it will lead you back to the northernmost room. Head out of the room, then keep exploring the area containing many rooms if you haven't done that.</p> 
                    <p>If you want to clear the area, jump down the hole near the entrance of the frozen room. After jumping, you'll find x2 Innard Meat from a dead body nearby. Follow the path going west. You will arrive in a dark area containing two <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Giant Rat" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Giant+Rat">Giant Rats</a>. It's a dark area, so it is advisable to use a torch for this part. After dealing with the rats, follow the path going west, heading deeper into Lamenter's Gaol. You will encounter more Giant Rats in this area, which you deal with easily. In this room, there will be two paths that you can take. The path on the right will have a ladder going up, but two giant rats will be in the area. The ladder going up will lead you back to the frozen area with many rooms. The left path heads deeper into Lamenter's Gaol, leading you into a room with Giant Rats. You can also pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Clarifying Horn Charm 2" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Clarifying+Horn+Charm+2">Clarifying Horn Charm +2</a> from a body near the blocked-off path. The area being blocked is the one where you retrieved the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Gaol Lower Level Key" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Gaol+Lower+Level+Key" target="">Gaol Lower Level Key</a> earlier.</p> 
                    <p>To make your way back, go back to the tunnel where you came from. The path will then fork, a left and a right path. The right path leads to where you came from. The left path will be the one that leads back to the frozen room, as it leads you back to the ladder room you found earlier.</p> 
                    <p>Make your way back to the frozen room by following the path, then head to the northernmost room filled with jars. You can use the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Gaol Lower Level Key" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Gaol+Lower+Level+Key" target="">Gaol Lower Level Key</a> to open the locked door. Once you have unlocked the door, go down the ladder. You will see a boss fog directly in front of you. Prepare yourself for combat, as you will be facing the boss of this area, the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Lamenter" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Lamenter" target="">Lamenter</a>.</p> 
                    <p>The Lamenter is a boss that is smaller than the usual bosses you encounter in this game. The Lamenter is an agile boss that relies on the use of its clones to deceive and confuse the player. Its clones will die in one hit, but hitting the clones will not damage the real Lamenter. <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Lamenter" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Lamenter">Here</a> is an in-depth guide for defeating the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Lamenter" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Lamenter" target="">Lamenter</a>.</p>

From here, head east to make your way to the Hinterland Bridge. You will follow the path here and you can activate the next Site of Grace on the other side of the bridge. To begin exploring Hinterlands, you will head to Shaman Village. This is a beautiful garden area with leaves falling around.</p> 
                    <p>From the Site of Grace, follow the main path on your right and as you turn here, near the ramp, you will encounter a Tree Sentinel.

There's another Tree Sentinel here that you can choose to fight or run away from. Continue ahead and go past the bridge. Use the Hinterlands Bridge - Site of Grace before proceeding. </p>

                    <ul>

                    <p>To continue Jolan's questline, you need to return to Hinterlands, go to <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shaman Village" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shaman+Village" target="">Shaman Village</a>, and go to the very top of  Rabbath's Rise. Look for a pathway at the back of the village, and travel down the cliffside, leading to a secret top part of Rabbath's Rise.

                    <p>Teleport to the Dragon's Pit Terminus - Site of Grace then head southeast and go past the arena where the lone <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Jagged Peak Drake" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Jagged+Peak+Drake" target="">Jagged Peak Drake</a> was, but this time, you will head north and pass through the pillars. This will take you to the cliff of the mountain.</p> 
                    <p>Use the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Spiritspring" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Spiritspring" target="">Spiritspring</a> at the end of this path, then veer right and cross the bridge. Activate the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Foot of the Jagged Peak" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Foot+of+the+Jagged+Peak">Foot of the Jagged Peak</a> site of grace here before proceeding. This is very important because you will be fighting a boss in the next area. This is where you will respawn if you die during the fight.</p> 
                    <p> Next, continue up ahead until you reach the boss arena. You will be fighting another <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Jagged Peak Drake" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Jagged+Peak+Drake" target="">Jagged Peak Drake</a>, but this time, there will be two of them. After this fight, you will hear the voice of Igon nearby. Locate him towards the east and head towards the area where the red smoke is thick. Talk to him there and exhaust his dialogues. He will ask you to summon him and let him join you in the fight against <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Bayle the Dread" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bayle+the+Dread" target="">Bayle the Dread</a>. You will receive <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Igon's Furled Finger" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Igon's+Furled+Finger" target="">Igon's Furled Finger</a>.</p> 
                    <p>From here, take the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Spiritspring" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Spiritspring" target="">Spiritspring</a> behind him, and another one at the next level. On the third level, you will see the entrance to the cave of the next dragon. Go inside the cave and watch out for the rolling boulders here. You can avoid it by going to the right area of the cave, and then crossing right after the boulder rolls down. Before crossing, you also need to pay attention to an item on your right at the end and pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Scadutree Fragment" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scadutree+Fragment" target="">Scadutree Fragment</a> here. Once you make it to the left side of the room, you will reach the arena of another boss. </p> 
                    <p>You will be fighting <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ancient Dragon Senessax" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ancient+Dragon+Senessax" target="">Ancient Dragon Senessax</a>. After defeating this boss, go up the north exit where you will see the remains of other dragons on the ground. This serves as your guide that you are headed to the right place.</p> 
                    <p>Outside this area, activate the Jagged Peak Mountainside - Site of Grace. Then, head to the top of the mountain by heading southwest. You will see the dragon remains here and keep following it. There are also lightning effects that will occasionally strike. Then, use the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Spiritspring" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Spiritspring" target="">Spiritspring</a> and continue going to the south. </p> 
                    <p>Stick to the wall here to your left and use another <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Spiritspring" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Spiritspring" target="">Spiritspring</a>. You will find yourself at a level with multiple dragon remains and a small cave entrance in front of you. Go inside and pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ancient+Dragon+Smithing+Stone" target="">Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone</a> on the right side, then walk over to your left and use another <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Spiritspring" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Spiritspring" target="">Spiritspring</a> at the end.</p> 
                    <p>Use the Site of Grace at the top and this is the one that you will be using in case you die during the boss fight. (Beware: You probably will). Go towards the small opening here and once you enter the arena, <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Bayle the Dread" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bayle+the+Dread" target="">Bayle the Dread</a> will land once you are inside. Now, the key to completing Igon is to summon him here. He can't be summoned from the outside, but you need to locate his summon sign inside the arena after this boss fight is triggered.</p> 
                    <p>After defeating this boss, return to Igon's last location where you fought the two <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Jagged Peak Drake" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Jagged+Peak+Drake" target="">Jagged Peak Drake</a>.

Make sure to read this guide to avoid canceling quests unintentionally.</p> 
                    <p><strong>Shadow Keep acts as a hub for the main story progression and major NPC questlines. You will be coming and going here and the sections are separated into 3, each with different objectives every time you go in</strong>:</p> 
                    <ul> 
                        <li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Shadow Keep (Church District and Scadutree Base): Drain the water to access the lower area.

                        <li>Shadow Keep Depths (Recluse River): This is an area that can be accessed through an illusory wall and reveals access to <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Eastern Nameless Mausoleum" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Eastern+Nameless+Mausoleum" target="">Eastern Nameless Mausoleum</a> and <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Darklight Catacombs" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Darklight+Catacombs" target="">Darklight Catacombs</a>. This is also how you will gain entry to the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Abyssal Woods" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Abyssal+Woods" target="">Abyssal Woods</a>. As you discover the secret access here, you will also stop by the area above Main Plaza to take part in the Needle Knight Leda and Hornsent fight.</li> 
                        <li>Shadow Keep (Main): This is the third and final exploration of Shadow Keep and ends with defeating the main boss of this legacy dungeon. This section is also where you will progress Sir Ansbach and Redmane Freyja's quests.</li> 
                    </ul> 
                    <p>The main entrance of the Shadow Keep is pretty linear, as you can follow the path directly from Castle Ensis leading to the main entrance of the Shadow Keep. Along the path, you will encounter Messmer Soldiers in encampments, so tread carefully. By the eastern section of the keep's outer walls, you can loot a fallen <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Furnace Golem" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Furnace+Golem" target="">Furnace Golem</a> for x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Furnace Visage" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Furnace+Visage" target="">Furnace Visage</a>. Nearby, you can find a tent containing a corpse with x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Furnace Keeper's Note" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Furnace+Keeper's+Note" target="">Furnace Keeper's Note</a>. Return to the path, and you will find a big archway to a room containing a lift. This will take you to the Shadow Keep Main Gate Site of Grace [<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree Map?id=655322&amp;code=mapD" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+of+the+Erdtree+Map?id=655322&amp;code=mapD">See Elden Ring Map</a>].</p> 
                    <p>When you arrive at the top of the lift, activate the Site of Grace. The area ahead of it is a boss room. Once you are ready to fight it, enter the room and you will encounter the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Golden Hippopotamus" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Hippopotamus" target="">Golden Hippopotamus</a>. Its attacks have a deceptively big hit box, using mostly its head to attack. For more guides and strategies on how to defeat the boss, you can visit this page. After defeating the Golden Hippopotamus, it will drop x2 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Scadutree Fragment" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scadutree+Fragment" target="">Scadutree Fragment</a> and the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Aspects of the Crucible: Thorns" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Aspects+of+the+Crucible:+Thorns" target="">Aspects of the Crucible: Thorns</a> Incantation. Defeating the Golden Hippopotamus will give you access to the Main Plaza of the Shadow Keep, allowing you to explore the whole area. The Main Gate Plaza Site of Grace [<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree Map?id=655324&amp;code=mapD" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+of+the+Erdtree+Map?id=655324&amp;code=mapD">See Elden Ring Map</a>] will be unlocked after the boss fight, so you can activate it now.</p> 
                    <p>After defeating the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Golden Hippopotamus" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Hippopotamus" target="">Golden Hippopotamus</a>, you can head to the western archway to continue heading deeper into the Shadow Keep. Follow the path, and you will encounter two Messmer Soldiers overlooking the ledge on your left. After defeating them, pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Festive Grease" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Festive+Grease" target="">Festive Grease</a> from a corpse, and you'll encounter another Messmer Soldier going down the stairs.</p> 
                    <p>In the middle of the stairs, you can find a room with two more Messmer Soldiers along with a corpse that you can loot for x6 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithing Stone [1]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+[1]" target="">Smithing Stone [1]</a>. You can find another room connected to this room on the right side, which contains two more Messmer Soldiers along with a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Black Knight" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Black+Knight" target="">Black Knight</a>. On the dead body by the south side of the room, you can pick up the dagger <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Main-gauche" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Main-gauche" target="">Main-gauche</a>. Afterward, head back out the stairs on the west, then keep going up.</p> 
                    <p>You will encounter two Messmer Soldiers looking over the ledge on the left with a corpse that you can loot for x7 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Redflesh Mushroom" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Redflesh+Mushroom">Redflesh Mushrooms</a>, and two more Messmer Soldiers on the right. After defeating the Messmer Soldiers, head up the stairs again to find another room. There will be three <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Black Knight" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Black+Knight">Black Knights</a> inside the room; one wielding a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring hammers" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/hammers">hammer</a> and <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring greatshields" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/greatshields">greatshield</a>, the second one using a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring greatbows" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/greatbows">greatbow</a>, and the third one wielding a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring twinblades" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/twinblades" target="">twinblade</a>. You can deal with the first Black Knight by dragging him outside of the room to where you came from, then you can deal with the other two easily inside the room. On the opening on the south wall of the room, you can pick up x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Golden Vow" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Vow" target="">Golden Vow</a> from corpse hanging by the ledge and x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow Realm Rune (6)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+Realm+Rune+(6)">Shadow Realm Rune [6]</a> from a body near the archway on the east.</p> 
                    <p>As you head out of the room, you can drop down from the bridge on the left side, and you'll find x5 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithing Stone [5]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+[5]" target="">Smithing Stone [5]</a> from a dead body. Continue heading south, and you will see a golden tree. Directly beside it, you can pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Talisman of Lord's Bestowal" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Talisman+of+Lord's+Bestowal" target="">Talisman of Lord's Bestowal</a>. In the room south of the tree, you can pick up x2 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithing Stone [8]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+[8]" target="">Smithing Stone [8]</a> from a dead body on the ledge northwest of the room. Northwest of the plaza, you can find a Black Knight facing a dead body with an item. Defeat the Black Knight, then pick up the x3 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Golden Vow" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Vow" target="">Golden Vow</a> on the dead body. You can get back up by entering the room east of the corpse, which will contain a Messmer Soldier and a Black Knight. A ladder room will be on the eastern side, which leads you back to the room with the three Black Knights that you just fought.</p> 
                    <p>After opening the door back to the room, head east again through the archway to continue progressing through the Shadow Keep. On the northeastern side, which is a dead-end, you can loot a body for x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Holyproof Pickled Liver" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Holyproof+Pickled+Liver" target="">Holyproof Pickled Liver</a>. Keep following the path going to the southeast, and you'll encounter Shadow Militiamen by the boats. By the stairs heading up, you can pick up x1 Messmerfire Grease from the dead body lying on the stairs. South of it, you can find a ramp going down, in which you will encounter more Shadow Militiamen. Open the double door, which leads you back to the Main Gate Plaza Site of Grace.</p> 
                    <p>Head back up the ramp, and you'll notice two summon signs on the right side. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>NOTE</strong></span>: You can only interact with one summon sign, so choose which reward you want to receive. Your choice will also lock you out of certain future rewards.</p> 
                    <p>If you interact with the red sign, you will be summoned to assist <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Needle Knight Leda" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Needle+Knight+Leda" target="">Needle Knight Leda</a> in defeating <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Hornsent" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Hornsent" target="">Hornsent</a> - This will reward you with the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Hornsent Set" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Hornsent+Set" target="">Hornsent Set</a> along with the curved sword <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Falx" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Falx" target="">Falx</a>. If you interact with the yellow sign, you will be summoned to assist Hornsent in defeating Needle Knight Leda - This will reward you with the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ash of War: Swift Slash" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ash+of+War:+Swift+Slash" target="">Ash of War: Swift Slash</a> and <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Leda's Rune" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Leda's+Rune" target="">Leda's Rune</a>. We recommend reading both <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Hornsent" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Hornsent" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hornsent</a> and <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Needle Knight Leda" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Needle+Knight+Leda" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leda's</a> NPC pages to help decide which rewards to receive and which to be locked out of.</p> 
                    <p>After doing the summon signs, you can head east to explore the area. You'll find x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Rada Fruit" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rada+Fruit" target="">Rada Fruit</a> on a dead body sitting against a boat right next to the summon signs. You can also pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Silver-Pickled Fowl Foot" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Silver-Pickled+Fowl+Foot" target="">Silver-Pickled Fowl Foot</a> from a body nearby. Lastly, on the southeastern wall, you'll find another corpse which has x3 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithing Stone [8]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+[8]" target="">Smithing Stone [8]</a>. Go back to the body where you picked up the Silver-Pickled Fowl Foot, then climb down the ladder by the opening of the railing nearby.</p> 
                    <p>After you have arrived at the bottom of the ladder, follow the path going northwest until you come across with a dead body that has x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Somber Smithing Stone [8]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone+[8]" target="">Somber Smithing Stone [8]</a>. Go back to the waterfall you passed through earlier, then go inside of the passageway behind it. Follow the path, then go down the ladder. Once you are at the bottom, go east to find a room with a painting. Pick it up, and you will receive the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Domain of Dragons Painting" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Domain+of+Dragons+Painting" target="">Domain of Dragons Painting</a>.</p> 
                    <p>Then pay attention to the wall behind you. This blank wall is a secret passage, and you can attack it to reveal a new area. To continue, go through the secret room and follow the stream of water. Go down the steps and turn left. You will see a coffin at the edge here. Rest in the coffin to travel to a new location. After the short cutscene plays you will arrive at a new location. Go through the door then activate the Castle Watering Hole Site of Grace [<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Interactive Map?id=655666&amp;code=mapD" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=655666&amp;code=mapD">See Elden Ring Map</a>] left of the doorway. Then, summon <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Torrent" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Torrent" target="">Torrent</a> and ride southeast here. You will come across a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Furnace Golem" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Furnace+Golem" target="">Furnace Golem</a> here and it's up to you if you want to defeat it.</p> 
                    <p>Defeating this Furnace Golem drops the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Oil-Soaked Tear" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Oil-Soaked+Tear" target="">Oil-Soaked Tear</a> crystal tear and a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Furnace Visage" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Furnace+Visage" target="">Furnace Visage</a>. Defeat it and head toward the ruins and you'll notice one "dead" or "unlit" Furnace Golem blocking the entrance to Ruins of Unte. Head to the east side and use your mount to jump over the rubble and remains of the buildings until you reach the balcony overlooking the "dead" Furnace Golem. To wake up the Golem, you need to have a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Hefty Furnace Pot" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Hefty+Furnace+Pot" target="">Hefty Furnace Pot</a> in your inventory, equip it, and throw it on its head.</p> 
                    <p>A <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Hefty Furnace Pot" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Hefty+Furnace+Pot" target="">Hefty Furnace Pot</a> can be crafted with the following materials: x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Redflesh Mushroom" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Redflesh+Mushroom" target="">Redflesh Mushroom</a>, x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ember of Messmer" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ember+of+Messmer" target="">Ember of Messmer</a>, and x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Furnace Visage" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Furnace+Visage" target="">Furnace Visage</a>.

After clearing this area, return to the Castle Watering Hole to explore the river under Eastern Scadu Altus.</p> 
                    <p>From the Castle Watering Hole - Site of Grace, travel south and stick to the mountainside on your left. As you reach the waterfall you will find the Recluses' River Upstream - Site of Grace. Activate this and continue following the rock path to the south. Make sure to pay attention to the open gaps along the path. Once the path to the left side ends, jump over to the other side. This time, you will stick to the mountainside to the right. Take note of the gravesites on your left, we will return here shortly. When you reach the end of the rock path, you can safely drop down to the Site of Grace.</p> 
                    <p>From this Recluses' River Downstream Site of Grace [<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Interactive Map?id=655330&amp;code=mapD" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=655330&amp;code=mapD">See Elden Ring Map</a>], head back up to the north and follow the path going northeast until you can cross to the gravesite area. Be careful here as multiple <a title="Elden Ring Gravebird" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Gravebird" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravebird</a> enemies will try to attack you. After dealing with the Gravebirds, drop down to the platform below the gravesite. Here you can pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Dryleaf Seal" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dryleaf+Seal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dryleaf Seal</a>. Continue dropping until you reach the top of the waterfall here. From the top of the waterfall, follow the river going northwest past a few <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Miranda Sprout" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Miranda+Sprout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miranda Sprout</a> enemies until you reach a dead end. Here you will find a stone coffin with x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Scadutree Fragment" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scadutree+Fragment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scadutree Fragment</a> inside.

                    <p>At the bottom, first go underneath the waterfall to pick up the rest of <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Dane's Set" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dane's+Set" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dane's Set</a>, then head east, and continue to the end where you'll find the entrance to the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Eastern Nameless Mausoleum" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Eastern+Nameless+Mausoleum" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eastern Nameless Mausoleum</a>. </p> 
                    <p>There is a Summoning Pool or effigy by the entrance for players to use for co-op. There is also a Stake of Marika that you can use to respawn by the entrance of the mausoleum in case you die. As mentioned, the location is where you'll fight against a mini-boss, so make preparations before you pass through the mist.

                    </ul> 
                    <p>After this fight, return to Recluses' River Downstream - Site of Grace to pass by Village of Flies before you travel to Darklight Catacombs. From the grace, jump down and continue navigating ahead. You will know that you are in the right area if there are Giant Flies on your path. As you reach the ground level, a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Curseblade" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Curseblade" target="">Curseblade</a> will attack you.

You can pick up a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Silver Horn Tender" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Silver+Horn+Tender" target="">Silver Horn Tender</a> here found next to destroyed pots and corpses.

Jump down to another level below you. Continue traversing below.</p> 
                    <p>Stick to this ledge and you will be facing east. Keep going until the path ends and you start to see gravesites in the level below you. Jump down next to the tombs and face northeast.

A lionhead <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Imp" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Imp" target="">Imp</a> will jump on you as you approach the item, so take caution. Once you have picked up the Grave Glovewort, go to the eastern hall right before picking up the loot.

                    <p>Follow the path north, going through the ramp on the right side to progress. A Fanged Imp will be waiting for you at the bottom of the ramp. Keep heading north, and you'll find x1 Yellow Fulgurbloom along with a bigmouth Imp opposite of it. After dealing with the imp, go back a few steps and you'll see a ladder going up. Climb the ladder, then turn right through the tight passageway, dropping to a room with a lever. Pull the lever, and you will activate the lights in another area.

                    <p>You'll find a broken section of the railings. Drop down to the ledge below it, and you'll find a hallway with an Inquisitor on the southeastern corner. In this hallway, you can obtain the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Death Knight Set" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Death+Knight+Set" target="">Death Knight Set</a> from a dead body by the ledge on the north.

There will be a section here that has a pillar that can serve as a safe spot for you. As you are in the safe spot, a Fanged Imp will approach you. After dealing with the Fanged Imp, sprint to the area where it came from, then pull the lever in the room. Afterwards, kill the giant <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Bigmouth Imp" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bigmouth+Imp" target="">Bigmouth Imp</a>, then defeat the Fanged Imp that spawns after it.</p> 
                    <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>NOTE</strong></span>: Do not kill the Giant Bigmouth Imp before pulling the lever, or else the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Great Ghost Glovewort" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Great+Ghost+Glovewort" target="">Great Ghost Glovewort</a> that it drops will be stuck on the platform.</p>

                    <p>From there, head south and follow the dirt path. You will pass through some creatures here and skeleton enemies. As soon as you see the elevated thick tree, turn left and you will be heading east this time. You know that you are in the right place if you can spot the church-like structure from a distance.

                    <p>To continue exploring Abyssal Woods, you will now head to Midra's Manse. To do this, teleport to the Woodland Trail Site of Grace [<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Interactive Map?id=655667&amp;code=mapD" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=655667&amp;code=mapD">See Elden Ring Map</a>] and then face the west direction.

Head north and go towards the tall archway at the far end. After the archway, face the western direction and keep walking. Watch out for the enemies patrolling here. At the end, you will see a waterfall and Divided Falls - Site of Grace.</p> 
                    <p>Backtrack a little and go under the bridge to the southeast. You can see 2 enemies here, but you can try to fight them or outrun them. Then, jump down and turn right. Look for a ramp to your left and climb it by jumping between the stones. Stick to the right wall and then jump down again.</p> 
                    <p>You will see a building in the distance to the south and this is the Midra's Manse. You will find the door here directly on your south if you stick to the right wall. As you enter the room, a voice can be heard asking you to leave. </p> 
                    <p>In this room, you can turn right to find a room with a dead body containing x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Swollen Grape" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Swollen+Grape" target="">Swollen Grape</a>.

The door on the west side of the hall will be locked, so hit the painting opposite of it to reveal a hidden hallway.  </p> 
                    <p>Proceed through the hallway, and you will find a room on your left. Enter the room, then pick up x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Torn Diary Page" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Torn+Diary+Page" target="">Torn Diary Page</a> on a dead body.

Head back out the hallway through either of the two doorways in the room. </p> 
                    <p>After heading out, you will encounter a Horned Warrior patrolling around the hallway. Once you have dealt with the Horned Warrior, you can follow the hallway going east, then going around the corner to find another room. Enter the room filled with Shadow Undead, along with a Shadow Undead above using the incantation <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring The Flame of Frenzy" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/The+Flame+of+Frenzy" target="">The Flame of Frenzy</a> on you.</p>

You can sneak past the Horned Warrior as its pathing will only be in the direction it is facing. Follow the room going southwest, and a Shadow Undead will be waiting for you around the corner. The Shadow Undead will try to get a jump on you, so attack it right as you are going around the corner. After dealing with the Shadow Undead, head to the room opposite of it, then pull the lever.   </p> 
                    <p>After pulling the lever, follow the room on the east, hugging the wall, and you will find a ladder going up. You'll end up in a room with <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow Undead" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+Undead" target="">Shadow Undead</a> scattered around. You can pick up x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow Realm Rune (6)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+Realm+Rune+(6)">Shadow Realm Rune [6]</a> from a dead body hanging by a beam.

                    <p>At the upper level, you will be walking across beams. As you traverse through the beams, there will be Frenzied Giant Rats on the right archway that might attack you. If you enter the dark room the rats are in, you can loot x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Mad Craftsman's Cookbook (3)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Mad+Craftsman's+Cookbook+(3)">Mad Craftsman's Cookbook [3]</a>. Keep heading west, and you will arrive at the Midra's Library Site of Grace [<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Interactive Map?id=655673&amp;code=mapD" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=655673&amp;code=mapD">See Elden Ring Map</a>].  </p> 
                    <p>Head west of the Site of Grace, and you will be in the library. You will encounter frenzied enemies throughout the library. On your left, you can cross a beam to get on top of the library shelves. On the shelf in the middle, you can grab x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Golden Horn Tender" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Horn+Tender" target="">Golden Horn Tender</a> from a dead body. You can drop down to another shelf, which contains x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow Realm Rune (7)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+Realm+Rune+(7)">Shadow Realm Rune [7]</a>. Drop down the shelf, then go to the eastern side to find a door.</p> 
                    <p>Open the door to gain access to a shortcut to Manse Hall. After opening the door, look at the southern wall with the painting just before the previously closed door. Attack it to reveal another hidden path. This leads to a lever that you can pull to move a bookshelf, opening up another path.</p> 
                    <p>Backtrack your way to the bookshelf where you obtained a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Golden Horn Tender" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Horn+Tender" target="">Golden Horn Tender</a>. Instead of dropping down again, jump on the ledge north of it. Follow the path, crossing the run-down path. Make the jump to get to a balcony with a dead body, in which you can loot x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Nanaya's Torch" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Nanaya's+Torch" target="">Nanaya's Torch</a> </p> 
                    <p>On the recently opened path, head up the stairs. You can pick up x2 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Swollen Grape" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Swollen+Grape" target="">Swollen Grape</a> from a dead body just before the path. You will be in a room on the upper level of the library, along with a Greater Inquisitor in the area which drops a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Revered Spirit Ash" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Revered+Spirit+Ash" target="">Revered Spirit Ash</a>. After defeating the shaman, head up another set of stairs on the east. Keep following the path, clearing the room of the Cursed Priests, and you will discover the Second Floor Chamber Site of Grace [<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Interactive Map?id=655674&amp;code=mapD" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=655674&amp;code=mapD">See Elden Ring Map</a>].</p> 
                    <p>Head north of the Site of Grace, and you will see a chandelier along with a ladder going down. Jump to the chandelier to obtain x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Revered Spirit Ash" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Revered+Spirit+Ash" target="">Revered Spirit Ash</a>. You can drop down safely to the ground without receiving any damage.</p> 
                    <p>Backtrack your way up to the Second Floor Chamber Site of Grace, then go directly east of it through the archway. You will hear a person wailing in the room nearby. Approach the wailing man, and it will be hostile towards you. Defeat the enemy, and it will trigger a cutscene.</p> 
                    <p>After defeating the wailing man, it will then be revealed in the cutscene that he is Midra, Lord of Frenzied Flame. You will then fight the true form of Midra, the embodiment of the Frenzied Flame. He will be using a spear made out of the weapon that was formerly impaling him.

                    </ul> 
                    <p>After exploring Abyssal Woods, teleport to the Main Gate Plaza and head to the path you opened facing the southeast direction. Go up the ramp, in which you'll be surrounded by four <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow Militiamen" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+Militiamen" target="">Shadow Militiamen</a>. After arriving at the top of the ramp, you can head up the stairs. You can pick up x8 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Bone Dart" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bone+Dart" target="">Bone Dart</a> from a corpse by the stairs. A Fire Knight will be waiting across the bridge. As you are walking to the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Fire Knight" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fire+Knight" target="">Fire Knight</a>, pick up the x8 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithing Stone (2)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+(2)">Smithing Stone [2]</a> from the dead body. The Fire Knight uses slow wide swings when attacking, so you can attack or even stagger it after dodging one attack.</p> 
                    <p>After defeating the Fire Knight, you can go through the big archway it was previously patrolling, which leads to a lift. Use the lift to go up, and you will end up in the Storehouse, First Floor Site of Grace [<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree Map?id=655353&amp;code=mapD" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+of+the+Erdtree+Map?id=655353&amp;code=mapD">See Elden Ring Map</a>].</p>

Head inside the room, and you will find a lift which you can ride going down.</p> 
                    <p>After arriving at the bottom of the lift, you will be in a room connecting two other rooms. In the room west, you will find a corpse that you can loot for x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Gold-Pickled Fowl Foot" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Gold-Pickled+Fowl+Foot" target="">Gold-Pickled Fowl Foot</a> along with a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Living Jar" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Living+Jar" target="">Living Jar</a> hiding by the entrance of the room. The second room is a hallway, which also connects two more rooms.

                    <p>In the northern room, you'll find a Living Jar running up the stairs. Defeat the Living Jar, but don't go down the stairs yet. Go to the hallway beside the stairs, then hit the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Illusory wall" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Illusory+wall" target="">Illusory wall</a> to reveal a hidden room.

Head south to get into another room filled with more Living Jars. On the eastern side, you'll find a Living Jar standing in front of an item. Defeat the Living Jar and two more small Living Jars, then loot the item to receive the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Iris of Grace" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Iris+of+Grace" target="">Iris of Grace</a> - an item you can hand over to an NPC later.

                    <p>After clearing the room, head west to enter a room. Be cautious as you are entering the room, as a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Living Jar" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Living+Jar" target="">Living Jar</a> will attack you on the right side. Head down either staircase, as they both lead to the same area. This room leads outside to the West Rampart Site of Grace [<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree Map?id=655319&amp;code=mapD" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+of+the+Erdtree+Map?id=655319&amp;code=mapD">See Elden Ring Map</a>], which leads to another region. Travel back to the Storehouse, First Floor Site of Grace to resume exploring the Shadow Keep.</p> 
                    <p>As soon as you arrive on the first floor, head east to find a dead corpse containing x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Fireproof Pickled Liver" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fireproof+Pickled+Liver" target="">Fireproof Pickled Liver</a>. Afterwards, head west, passing by the archway instead of going inside the room. You'll find a path by the base of the specimen in the middle of the room going northeast. You will encounter numerous Shadow Undead and <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow Militiamen" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+Militiamen" target="">Shadow Militiamen</a> on the first floor of the Specimen Storehouse. Keep following the path, and you'll find a staircase going to the left, along with an Undead Shadow in the middle of it.</p> 
                    <p>Go up the stairs, and you'll find yourself in a big room filled with bookcases.

In this room, you will find <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ansbach" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ansbach" target="">Ansbach</a> on the northeastern corner of the room reading a scripture. Talk to him, and exhaust all of Ansbach's dialogues. Head back out of the room, then follow the path going northwest. Turn right on the first one, and you'll find two Shadow Undead reading books, along with a hostile Shadow Undead and a Vulgar Militiaman at the base of a staircase.</p> 
                    <p>After dealing with the enemies, you can keep exploring the west side of the first floor wherein you'll find a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Fire Knight" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fire+Knight" target="">Fire Knight</a> patrolling around a big bookcase. You can get a jump on the Fire Knight as you can easily backstab it. On the southern side of the bookcase, you'll find a corpse containing x5 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithing Stone [8]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+[8]" target="">Smithing Stone [8]</a>. After looting the corpse, you can now head up the stairs.</p> 
                    <p>After getting on top of the stairs, go up the smaller set of steps on the left side. On the west side, you'll find a corpse containing x4 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Black Pyrefly" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Black+Pyrefly" target="">Black Pyrefly</a> sitting against a table.

                    <p>Once you have picked up the smithing stone, you can drop down the railing opposite of it.

You'll find x2 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ember of Messmer" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ember+of+Messmer" target="">Ember of Messmer</a> on the dead body you'll find immediately after the path opens. Backtrack your way to the stairs going up, then head left again.</p> 
                    <p>Before going up the stairs going to the third floor, you can find a Fire Knight on the section underneath it. Defeat the Fire Knight, then pick up x4 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Beast Horn" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Beast+Horn" target="">Beast Horn</a> on the dead body next to it. You can then head up the stairs going to the third floor.</p> 
                    <p>Once you go up the stairs, you'll find a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Fire Knight" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fire+Knight" target="">Fire Knight</a> by the southwestern side looking over the ledge. Defeat the Fire Knight first to make it easier to explore the third floor. <a id="pearldrake"></a><strong>NOTE</strong>: Take note of this location, as you'll have to backtrack to this location after a certain event. Afterwards, you are free to explore the floor as it is only filled with numerous Shadow Undead. On the south side of the third floor, you can loot x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Blessed Bone Shard" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Blessed+Bone+Shard" target="">Blessed Bone Shard</a> on a dead body sitting against books.</p> 
                    <p>On the western side of the third floor, you'll find a room filled with Shadow Undead reading scriptures. You'll also find a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Fire Knight" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fire+Knight" target="">Fire Knight</a> on the southwestern side of the room.

                    <p>Head back out of the room, then go up the area with railings. Cross the bridge on the south side.

                    <p>Head out the room by going through the archway west of the room, then follow the path going north.

After clearing the room, head out then defeat the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Fire Knight" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fire+Knight" target="">Fire Knight</a> across the bridge.  This Fire Knight is different than the rest of the Fire Knights you have found throughout exploring the Shadow Keep, as its attacks are more aggressive compared to the normal Fire Knights. Defeating this Fire Knight will give you the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Winged Serpent Helm" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Winged+Serpent+Helm" target="">Winged Serpent Helm</a> and <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ash of War: Flame Spear" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ash+of+War:+Flame+Spear" target="">Ash of War: Flame Spear</a>.</p>

Be prepared for a boss fight, as opening the door next to the Site of Grace will lead you to the boss of the Shadow Keep.</p> 
                    <p>After activating the Dark Chamber Entrance Site of Grace, you'll want to retrace your steps as to obtain the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Impenetrable Thorns" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Impenetrable+Thorns" target="">Impenetrable Thorns</a> sorcery. Return to the bridge where you fought <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Kood, Captain of the Fire Knights" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Kood,+Captain+of+the+Fire+Knights" target="">Kood, Captain of the Fire Knights</a>, then cross it to the other side. Head down the first set of staircases, where you will encounter two <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow Undead" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+Undead" target="">Shadow Undead</a> patrolling as you explore the area. You will then find a Shadow Undead overlooking the ledge. Defeat the Shadow Undead, then look down the ledge to see a platform wherein you can safely drop. After you drop to the platform, defeat the Giant Bat that you will encounter immediately after dropping. You will then see a dead body sitting against the wall nearby which you can then loot for the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Impenetrable Thorns" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Impenetrable+Thorns" target="">Impenetrable Thorns</a> sorcery. You can then return to the Dark Chamber Entrance Site of Grace to progress through the Shadow Keep.</p> 
                    <p>Near the Dark Chamber Entrance Site of Grace will be a door.

Messmer the Impaler uses a spear as a weapon, so be mindful of the range of his attacks. His spear and attacks will be imbued with fire, so having fire resistance would be a good idea for this boss fight.

                    <p>From the Shadow Keep, West Rampart - Site of Grace, head west and enter through the small archway on the right side of the bridge. It is recommended to ride <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Torrent" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Torrent" target="">Torrent</a> here as you cross the bridge so you can move faster and loot as you travel. There will be giant bats on this bridge but you will move fast enough and they shouldn't be able to reach you. You will find corpses with loot here; the first one to the left is a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithing Stone" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone" target="">Smithing Stone [3]</a>.

                    <p>At the other end of this bridge, you will encounter a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Fire Knight" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fire+Knight" target="">Fire Knight</a> wearing a red cloak. It wields dual daggers and can cast fire magic and will drop <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Salza's Hood" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Salza's+Hood" target="">Salza's Hood</a> and <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Rain of Fire" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rain+of+Fire" target="">Rain of Fire</a> upon defeating it.</p> 
                    <p>Go inside the building behind the enemy you just defeated and take the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Somber Smithing Stone" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone" target="">Somber Smithing Stone [9]</a> from the corpse on the corner. Go up the spiral stairs next to it and you will reach an elevator at the top. This will take you to a new gate and then, interact with the Viaduct Minor Tower - Site of Grace here.</p> 
                    <ul> 
                        <li>The southern area of the Ancient Ruins of Rauh covers exploring the parts near the Site of Grace. This includes the area below you that is accessible via the elevator in the small pond with small creatures. </li> 
                    </ul> 
                    <p>Head out the archway and go to the right side. Stick to the wall and ride past the thick greenery here. You will go around this building and at the back, you can pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Golden Horn Tender" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Horn+Tender" target="">Golden Horn Tender</a>. Go back the same way you came from, return to the entrance side, and head southeast past the small pond. You can see some boar creatures hanging out here and go behind the tree next to a stone pillar. Look for the corpse lying on top of a stone slab and pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Spirit Calculus" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Spirit+Calculus" target="">Spirit Calculus</a>. Then, use the elevator to reach the lower level.</p> 
                    <p>As you go down, face the southwest direction so you are ready for the Bloodfiend waiting here. Then, follow the path behind it where a group of Bloodfiends is gathered. This can be difficult since you are outnumbered, but if you have a magic build, you can use <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Adula's Moonblade" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Adula's+Moonblade" target="">Adula's Moonblade</a> to effectively take out the group. After fighting them, you can pick up <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Somber Smithing Stone" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone" target="">Somber Smithing Stone [8]</a> from the corpse being defended by the group. From here, face the southwest direction and exit through the small square hole.</p> 
                    <p>Go to the right side and go past the Bloodfiend. There's a corpse near the edge and you can pick up 8x <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Thin Beast Bones" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Thin+Beast+Bones" target="">Thin Beast Bones</a> from it. Now face southeast here and go towards the edge and jump down on the steps below you. Look to your right and fight the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Hippopotamus" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Hippopotamus" target="">Hippopotamus</a>.</p> 
                    <p>This looks just like the boss at the Main Entrance of <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow Keep" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+Keep" target="">Shadow Keep</a> but this one has a smaller health pool. It can also pull off the same moves just like the boss version. Upon defeating it, it will drop a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Scadutree Fragment" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scadutree+Fragment" target="">Scadutree Fragment</a>. You are now done with this section. Return to the Site of Grace and continue exploring the eastern area through the felled tree.</p> 
                    <p>Upon exiting the archway, face the western direction and go through the collapsed tree this time. Follow the path ahead where you will see small creatures and turn right to enter the building marked by these 2 standing lanterns. This area is filled with <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow Undead" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+Undead" target="">Shadow Undead</a> enemies and there are variations of them. Others are hunched on the ground, while there are some walking around carrying a jar (<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadowpot" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadowpot" target="">Shadowpot</a>). Take note that some of these enemies carry an important item. If you see them glimmering in the dark, eliminate them to take their item.</p> 
                    <p>As you enter, go to your immediate right and climb up the overgrown roots. Head towards the northeast and turn left behind the pillar to pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Somber Smithing Stone" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone" target="">Somber Smithing Stone [9]</a> from the edge of this root. Go around this area and return to the entrance side and eliminate the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadowpot" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadowpot" target="">Shadowpot</a> here. This one is carrying a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Revered Spirit Ash" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Revered+Spirit+Ash" target="">Revered Spirit Ash</a> and a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Silver Horn Tender" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Silver+Horn+Tender" target="">Silver Horn Tender</a>. Pick it up later after you fight the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Curseblade" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Curseblade" target="">Curseblade</a>. This enemy type behaves similarly to the boss but has a smaller health pool. After defeating these enemies, face the northeast where you see the tall closed door.</p> 
                    <p>Don't enter through the door yet, instead turn left and you will see a burning cauldron in the distance. You can pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Fire Spritestone" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fire+Spritestone" target="">Fire Spritestone</a> on the right side of this cauldron. Then, return to the door but make sure to defeat the nearby enemies here so they can't interrupt you. Open up the door and head down the steps. You will be fighting a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Spider Scorpion" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Spider+Scorpion" target="">Spider Scorpion</a> here, then turn left where you will fight more of these scorpions. You can pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow Realm Rune (5)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+Realm+Rune+(5)">Shadow Realm Rune [5]</a> just past the lit brazier.</p> 
                    <p>After picking up this item, look behind you and attack the illusory wall with 2 lit braziers on each side. Go inside and pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Bondstone" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bondstone" target="">Bondstone</a> and <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Antiquity Scholar's Cookbook (2)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Antiquity+Scholar's+Cookbook+(2)" target="">Antiquity Scholar's Cookbook (2)</a>. Head back out to the room where you came from and head to the right side to progress. Go down the steps where a group of <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow Undead" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+Undead" target="">Shadow Undead</a> enemies are gathered. Pay attention to the glimmering one carrying a jar and make sure to eliminate the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadowpot" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadowpot" target="">Shadowpot</a> to get 3x <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Spirit Calculus" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Spirit+Calculus" target="">Spirit Calculus</a> from them. You can also pick up a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Broken Rune" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Broken+Rune" target="">Broken Rune</a> in front of this square hole to the southeast. (Take note of this location because you will be coming back here later)</p> 
                    <p>Go through this square hole and once you reach the other side, you will be fighting more Giant Scorpions. Watch out for the ones hiding and sleeping on the ceiling. They will attack you as you approach this loot on the corner. Go up the stones and take the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Somber Smithing Stone (6)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone+(6)" target="">Somber Smithing Stone (6)</a> from the corpse here. Exit this area and turn right. Look for this glimmering enemy carrying a jar and defeat it. It will drop a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Scadutree Fragment" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scadutree+Fragment" target="">Scadutree Fragment</a> and <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Golden Horn Tender" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Horn+Tender" target="">Golden Horn Tender</a>.</p> 
                    <p>Then, look behind you and face the northeast direction. You will be able to see the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Curseblade" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Curseblade" target="">Curseblade</a> waiting on the top section of the second pillar. This one refuses to go down unless you go near it so you can just use range attacks to defeat it without getting damaged. After killing it, walk in front of you and pick up the 5x <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Throwing Dagger" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Throwing+Dagger" target="">Throwing Dagger</a> on the next alcove.</p> 
                    <p>From the last alcove, turn right, then left. You will be facing a group of shadow enemies and a giant scorpion here. Make sure to take them out before you continue exploring here. Loot the corpse here to get <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Glass Shard" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Glass+Shard" target="">Glass Shard</a>. Continue up ahead and turn right to this room where you see a scorpion suspended in the air. You can see multiple corpses on the ground with loot on them but you need to eliminate this enemy first. Try not to the aggro of the Giant Scorpion on the other by doing ranged attacks. After doing so, pick up the x2 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Sliver of Meat" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Sliver+of+Meat" target="">Sliver of Meat</a>, x3 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Scorpion Liver" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scorpion+Liver" target="">Scorpion Liver</a>, and <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Spider Scorpion Ashes" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Spider+Scorpion+Ashes" target="">Spider Scorpion Ashes</a>.</p> 
                    <p>Head to the next area filled with white flowers and defeat the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Spider Scorpion" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Spider+Scorpion" target="">Spider Scorpions</a> here. You can also pick up 2x <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Dewgem" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dewgem" target="">Dewgem</a> from the corpse here. Then, return to the other side of the square hole that you entered earlier. Trace your steps and return to the area where the shadow enemies are gathered. Open the door here facing southwest, then, take the 5x <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Rauh Burrow" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rauh+Burrow" target="">Rauh Burrow</a> from the corpse to your right.</p> 
                    <p>Follow this path until you reach the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Spiritspring" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Spiritspring" target="">Spiritspring</a> with surrounding nails. You can jump down here while riding Torrent and you will not be damaged. Face the southeast direction and go to the very end of this path. Pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow Realm Rune (6)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+Realm+Rune+(6)" target="">Shadow Realm Rune (6)</a> behind the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Spiritspring" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Spiritspring" target="">Spiritspring</a>. Don't go up the spiritspring and head back towards the area where you came from.</p> 
                    <p>Turn right behind the 3rd pillar, and then go up the thick roots to pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Fine Crucible Feather Talisman" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fine+Crucible+Feather+Talisman" target="">Fine Crucible Feather Talisman</a>. Then, head southwest and exit through the small archway at the end. Turn left and you will see an item on the top of the first archway to your left. Behind it, you can use the overgrown branch to climb this arch and then pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow Realm Rune (7)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+Realm+Rune+(7)" target="">Shadow Realm Rune (7)</a> from the corpse. Continue riding southeast and you will reach the outdoor area.</p> 
                    <p>When an enemy with a great hammer comes into view, don't try to take its aggro right away. You want to be able to reach the nearby Site of Grace here by walking only on the right side. Stick to the edge on your right and you will see Miquella's Cross here near the edge. The Rauh Ancient Ruins, East - Site of Grace is on your right and you can pick up an <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ancient Ruins Cross Message" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ancient+Ruins+Cross+Message" target="">Ancient Ruins Cross Message</a> and <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Scadutree Fragment" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scadutree+Fragment" target="">Scadutree Fragment</a> on the ground near the cross.</p> 
                    <p>Avoid the elite enemy first and from the Site of Grace, face northeast, and go towards the pillar at the edge. Walk over to the side to find an item near the waterfall. Pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ash of War: Dryleaf Whirlwind" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ash+of+War:+Dryleaf+Whirlwind" target="">Ash of War: Dryleaf Whirlwind</a> here. Then, return to the enemy that you saw earlier. This is <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Devonia Crucible Knight" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Devonia+Crucible+Knight">Devonia, Crucible Knight</a>, they will drop <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Devonia's Hammer" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Devonia's+Hammer" target="">Devonia's Hammer</a> and <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Crucible Hammer-Helm" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Crucible+Hammer-Helm" target="">Crucible Hammer-Helm</a> upon defeating them.</p> 
                    <p>After defeating this enemy, cross the bridge facing southwest. There's a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Furnace Golem" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Furnace+Golem" target="">Furnace Golem</a> at the other end of this bridge and it will start attacking you as you jump down. There are also <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow Undead" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+Undead" target="">Shadow Undead</a> enemies along the way and you can pick up 4x <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Dewgem" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dewgem" target="">Dewgem</a> and 2x <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Flight Pinion" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Flight+Pinion" target="">Flight Pinion</a>. Then, jump down to the right side here. Ride up ahead but make sure to sprint so you can safely reach the covered area here. Then, go past the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Furnace Golem" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Furnace+Golem" target="">Furnace Golem</a>, and don't fight it for now. The Rauh Ancient Ruins, West - Site of Grace is in the area behind it so you want to get the checkpoint first, just in case you die.</p> 
                    <p>From the Rauh Ancient Ruins, West - Site of Grace, go down the ramp and fight the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Furnace Golem" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Furnace+Golem" target="">Furnace Golem</a>. It will drop the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Crimson-Sapping Cracked Tear" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Crimson-Sapping+Cracked+Tear" target="">Crimson-Sapping Cracked Tear</a> and a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Furnace Visage" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Furnace+Visage" target="">Furnace Visage</a> upon defeating it.</p> 
                    <p>After fighting the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Furnace Golem" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Furnace+Golem" target="">Furnace Golem</a>, teleport to the Site that you had just activated. Face the southwest direction and go toward the double archway. There are different shadow enemies here, like shadow mage and shadow hound. Eliminate them as you go, and then go up the stairs to the right. You can pick up a 6x <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Kukri" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Kukri" target="">Kukri</a> on the steps and <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Redflesh Mushroom" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Redflesh+Mushroom" target="">Redflesh Mushroom</a> from the enemies.</p> 
                    <p>Go up the steps, then, go to the right side and eliminate the glimmering <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadowpot" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadowpot" target="">Shadowpot</a>. It will drop x3 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Spirit Calculus" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Spirit+Calculus" target="">Spirit Calculus</a> and a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Rauh Burrow" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rauh+Burrow" target="">Rauh Burrow</a>. Then, defeat the 2 Shadow Mages here. At the center of this map, there's a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Curseblade" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Curseblade" target="">Curseblade</a>. This one uses death spells and is just as dangerous as the boss version. On the northwest side, there's an altar where shadow enemies are worshipping. Go towards it and pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Scadutree Fragment" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scadutree+Fragment" target="">Scadutree Fragment</a>.</p> 
                    <p>Then, explore towards the south and then turn right. Make sure to pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Rauh Burrow" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rauh+Burrow" target="">Rauh Burrow</a> and 2x <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Spiritgrave Stone" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Spiritgrave+Stone" target="">Spiritgrave Stone</a> along the way. Then, use the elevator at the end of this path that will take you to the stone pillar section. Go to the left then carefully examine the area below you. You will notice some gaps in between platforms and while you're here, you want to make sure that you aim for the widest part to avoid dying. </p> 
                    <p>To begin, jump down on the stone pillar below you. Then, walk forward to the edge, then jump to the lower level. This should take you to the level where if you look behind you, you will see a corpse slumped against the pillar. You can go towards it and pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Four-Toed Fowl Foot" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Four-Toed+Fowl+Foot" target="">Four-Toed Fowl Foot</a> from the corpse.</p> 
                    <p>From here, face southeast and take the longer path but safer on your right. Follow the stone pathway towards the building on the far left. Be careful of the gaps as you jump to the other side. Once you reach the area to your left, eliminate the 2 enemies holding a candlestick standing in front of the steps here. Face the building and go towards the square hole, turn left, then turn left again to reach the chest. You can get the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Talisman of All Crucibles" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Talisman+of+All+Crucibles" target="">Talisman of All Crucibles</a> inside.</p> 
                    <p>While facing the chest, exit through the square hole to your right. Use the elevator to go up, and you can already see the Ancient Ruins, Grand Stairway - Site of Grace from the top. Walk towards it and activate it. </p> 
                    <p>Face the northwest direction, jump down the stairs, and then turn right to get loot. Stick to the wall to your right and then go to the very edge here to pick up a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Spirit Calculus" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Spirit+Calculus" target="">Spirit Calculus</a> from a corpse. Then, return to the grand stairway where you see the archer version of the Golem Warrior. You can go up the ramp behind it and take it out. This enemy is weak to heavy attacks so make sure to take full advantage of its weakness. </p> 
                    <p>Go down the broken bridge here and cross towards the northeast. Near the end of this bridge, you will find a corpse in the middle and you can take a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow Realm Rune (7)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+Realm+Rune+(7)" target="">Shadow Realm Rune (7)</a> from it. Then, jump down on the right side where you see a small temple-like location. There's a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Divine Beast Dancing Lion" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Divine+Beast+Dancing+Lion" target="">Divine Beast Dancing Lion</a> field boss here, and it's up to you if you want to fight it but you can run away from it by jumping down on the northeastern platform. This disables the fight and the boss will not chase you.</p> 
                    <p>There's an elite enemy in the middle of the pool. This one wields a dual curved sword and will drop the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Divine Bird Warrior Gauntlets" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Divine+Bird+Warrior+Gauntlets" target="">Divine Bird Warrior Gauntlets</a> upon defeating it. Go up the ramp on the left side to pick up 2x Beast Bones. Then, go to the area behind the boss to pick up <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Verdigris Discus" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Verdigris+Discus" target="">Verdigris Discus</a>. Continue exploring the southern area here to pick up a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Redflesh Mushroom" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Redflesh+Mushroom" target="">Redflesh Mushroom</a> from a corpse next to a pillar. This is your last stop in the Grand Stairway section, and you will now return to the Rauh Ancient Ruins, West - Site of Grace.</p> 
                    <ul> 
                        <li><strong>This covers the rest of the exploration of the western section where you will be invaded by an NPC.</strong></li> 
                    </ul> 
                    <p>From the Rauh Ancient Ruins, West - Site of Grace, face the southwest section and climb up the stairs to the left. This is the same area that you explored earlier but instead of going to the left section, you will head northwest towards the outdoor area. Head straight into the gazebo in front of you and you can pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Revered Spirit Ash" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Revered+Spirit+Ash" target="">Revered Spirit Ash</a> on this altar. Watch out for the enemy nearby but since you are riding Torrent, you can just outrun them.</p> 
                    <p>Continue exploring the path behind this gazebo and make sure to pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Rauh Burrow" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rauh+Burrow" target="">Rauh Burrow</a> on the wall. Take note of the location on your left with two lit braziers on the walls of the archway because you will be returning here later. For now, continue ahead and jump down on the platform behind the destroyed pillar.</p> 
                    <p>Go to the bottom of the steps and head northeast. You will find hounds inflicted with Scarlet Rot here and you can pick up <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Golden Horn Tender" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Horn+Tender" target="">Golden Horn Tender</a> from the corpse in the middle. There's also Bloodfiend here in the same area but it's up to you if you want to fight it. Continue traveling north where you will encounter another Bloodfiend, then turn left where more enemies are waiting. Take out the hounds and bloodfiends here for a chance to get <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Beast Blood" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Beast+Blood" target="">Beast Blood</a> and a piece of the Bloodfiend's gear, like <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Bloodfiend's Fork" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bloodfiend's+Fork" target="">Bloodfiend's Fork</a>. </p> 
                    <p>While facing northwest, look at the enemy above you and you will see this glimmering <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadowpot" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadowpot" target="">Shadowpot</a>. To go there, you need to head to area below it by jumping down. Summon <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Torrent" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Torrent" target="">Torrent</a> and try to land on the highest part here to minimize your fall damage. The elevator is right here when you go down, but before that, make sure to head to the open area on the northeast. This area is protected by giant flies so you need to eliminate them first.</p> 
                    <p>Take the Somber <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithing Stone (1)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+(1)" target="">Smithing Stone (1)</a> from the corpse lying on the stone. After doing so, head east where you see the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Miranda Sprout" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Miranda+Sprout" target="">Miranda Sprout</a>. Go towards it and then pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Aspects of the Crucible: Bloom" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Aspects+of+the+Crucible:+Bloom" target="">Aspects of the Crucible: Bloom</a>. Now, return to where you jumped down and take the elevator to go up. On the top level, you will reach the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadowpot" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadowpot" target="">Shadowpot</a> enemy. You can pick up a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Revered Spirit Ash" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Revered+Spirit+Ash" target="">Revered Spirit Ash</a> from it, and you can eliminate the nearby enemies to get a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Redflesh Mushroom" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Redflesh+Mushroom" target="">Redflesh Mushroom</a> and <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Silver Horn Tender" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Silver+Horn+Tender" target="">Silver Horn Tender</a>.</p> 
                    <p>This is your last stop in this area, and you will now be returning to the area that we mentioned that you will be coming back to. (The arch with lit braziers on each side). Jump down on the same ledge that you are facing as you approached the loot, then look at the pillar on your path and you will see a corpse here. Take the 3x <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Knot Resin" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Knot+Resin" target="">Knot Resin</a> from it then go up the stairs.</p> 
                    <p>Turn right where you will be facing scarlet rot-inflicted enemies. There's a scarlet version of <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Lesser Kindred of Rot (Pests)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Lesser+Kindred+of+Rot+(Pests)" target="">Lesser Kindred of Rot (Pests)</a> here, be careful of them because they can deal a high amount of damage when you get struck by them.</p> 
                    <p>Go to the northwest arch and pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Dappled White Cured Meat" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dappled+White+Cured+Meat" target="">Dappled White Cured Meat</a>. To your right, there are more pest enemies here. There's a large group of them in the next section and try to cheese them as much as you can. If you have any ranged or magic attacks, make use of them to eliminate them before they get near you. You can obtain these items from the ground here: x3 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Immunizing Cured Meat" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Immunizing+Cured+Meat" target="">Immunizing Cured Meat</a>, x4 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Fly Mold" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fly+Mold" target="">Fly Mold</a>, and <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithing Stone (2)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+(2)" target="">Smithing Stone (2)</a>.</p> 
                    <p>After fighting them, exit through the archway on the left side. You will reach a balcony-like area. Then, look on the stack of stones to your right and you will see a corpse here. You can pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Greater Potentate's Cookbook (9)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Greater+Potentate's+Cookbook+(9)" target="">Greater Potentate's Cookbook (9)</a> from it. Face the tower to the northeast and walk straight towards it. This is the Unseen Bridge that connects the main building to this tower. Cross to the other side and interact with the altar. If you have the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Stone-Sheathed Sword" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Stone-Sheathed+Sword" target="">Stone-Sheathed Sword</a>, you can use it on this altar to turn it into the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Sword of Light" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Sword+of+Light" target="">Sword of Light</a>.</p> 
                    <p>Go back to the main building the same way you got here and then continue exploring by going to the left past the room. Then, turn right to use the elevator that will take you to the upper level. There are more pest enemies here at the top and you will see the stairs in the middle. Just take note of these areas for now because you will be returning here later.</p> 
                    <p>First, turn your attention to the nearest enemy standing next to the archway then go out to the outdoor area. Go past the gazebo and look at the corpse in the middle of the water. Go towards it and then pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Divine Bird Feathers" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Divine+Bird+Feathers" target="">Divine Bird Feathers</a>.</p> 
                    <p>The elite enemy here will be aggro-ed upon picking up the item. Take your time as you deal with it and use the pillars of the gazebo to defend yourself against some of its attacks. After fighting it, go northeast past the gazebo to the upper area past the pond. Near the top, you will find a cluster of stones to destroy to unlock the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Spiritspring" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Spiritspring" target="">Spiritspring</a> below you. </p> 
                    <p>Jump towards the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Spiritspring" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Spiritspring" target="">Spiritspring</a>, then use it to reach the area on the other side. Go to the path on your right and walk to the area behind the thick pillar. Go around it to pick up x2 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Beast Horn" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Beast+Horn" target="">Beast Horn</a> from the corpse. Then, go up the stairs that you saw earlier and open the chest at the top to get <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Mottled Necklace 2" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Mottled+Necklace+2">Mottled Necklace +2</a>. Use the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Spiritspring" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Spiritspring" target="">Spiritspring</a> again to return to the main building. Head back inside where you used the elevator and then turn left to the area behind the stairs.</p> 
                    <p>Fight the pests that you will come across here and then turn right at the end. You can pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Pest-Thread Spears" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Pest-Thread+Spears" target="">Pest-Thread Spears</a> next to the wall on your right side. Go around this area and get ready for a fight before you head up the stairs. As you approach the top section, <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Hornsent" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Hornsent" target="">Hornsent</a> will invade you if you previously summoned him for your fight against Messmer. This is potentially a long walk back if you die here and you didn't activate the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Spiritspring" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Spiritspring" target="">Spiritspring</a> beforehand, but if you have been following this walkthrough, you will have a faster way of reaching this area in case you die in this fight. </p> 
                    <p>Defeating Hornsent here will reward you with the following items:</p> 
                    <ul>

                    <p>All that's left to do is to fight <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Romina, Saint of the Bud" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Romina,+Saint+of+the+Bud" target="">Romina, Saint of the Bud</a> then you're done in this location.

                    <p>In order to gain access to Enir-Ilim, you must first defeat <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Romina, Saint of the Bud" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Romina,+Saint+of+the+Bud" target="">Romina, Saint of the Bud</a> who is located in the Church of the Bud [<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Interactive Map?id=655463&amp;code=mapD" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=655463&amp;code=mapD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See Elden Ring Map</a>]. After defeating Romina, you will unlock the Church of the Bud Site of Grace in the Ancient Ruins of Rauh, which is a few steps away from the entrance to Enir-Ilim. Head to the archway south of the Church of Bud Site of Grace, and you will find a sealing tree. When you interact with the sealing tree, it states that it cannot be burned without Messmer's kindling. This means that you have to defeat <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Messmer the Impaler" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Messmer+the+Impaler" target="">Messmer the Impaler</a>, located in the Specimen Storehouse [<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Interactive Map?id=655484&amp;code=mapD" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=655484&amp;code=mapD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See Elden Ring Map</a>], who will then drop <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Messmer's Kindling" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Messmer's+Kindling" target="">Messmer's Kindling</a> along with the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Remembrance of the Impaler" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Remembrance+of+the+Impaler" target="">Remembrance of the Impaler</a>.</p> 
                    <p>Once you have <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Messmer's Kindling" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Messmer's+Kindling" target="">Messmer's Kindling</a>, you can head to the sealing tree to burn it, triggering a cutscene wherein Enir-Ilim's true form is revealed. After the cutscene, you will then be teleported to Enir-Ilim.</p> 
                    <p>Once you arrive in Enir-Ilim, look behind you to find a body containing x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Somber Smithing Stone [9]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone+[9]" target="">Somber Smithing Stone [9]</a>.

                    <p>Follow the path going east, up the stairs, in which you will see the Erdtree on the northeastern side. Keep following the path, then head up the stairs. Once you head up the stairs, a hostile Gravebird Knight will be approaching you. This enemy can fly, so watch out for its attacks. The staircase on the right is destroyed, so it leads to a dead-end. After dealing with the Gravebird Knight, head up the stairs on your left which leads to the First Rise Site of Grace [<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Interactive Map?id=655274&amp;code=mapD" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=655274&amp;code=mapD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See Elden Ring Map</a>].</p> 
                    <p>If you go to the stairs heading up on the south side of First Rise, you will find a body that you can loot for x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Somber Smithing Stone [5]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone+[5]" target="">Somber Smithing Stone [5]</a>. The staircase is destroyed, so it leads to a dead-end.</p> 
                    <p>Return to the bottom of the stairs, then head to the hallway heading east-southeast of the First Rise Site of Grace. You can loot a body containing x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Messmerfire Grease" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Messmerfire+Grease" target="">Messmerfire Grease</a> just before the archway. Enter the room to find a lift, which you will ride going down. Once at the bottom, head down the stairs, leading to Belurat, Tower Settlement [<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Interactive Map?id=654888&amp;code=mapD" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=654888&amp;code=mapD">See Elden Ring Map</a>]. At the bottom, you will find a Revered Spirit Ash.</p> 
                    <p>Return to the First Rise Site of Grace, looking southwest, you will see an archway that leads to a staircase going up. Go up the stairs, and you will end up in a courtyard. There will be a corpse on your right that you can loot for x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Broken Rune" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Broken+Rune" target="">Broken Rune</a>. Left of the corpse is a room where you will find two Tree Shamans, one will attack you and the other will be praying near the tree. After dealing with these enemies you will find a doorway to a staircase in the southwestern corner of the room. Follow the stairs to reach another Tree Shaman with x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Rune Arc" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rune+Arc" target="">Rune Arc</a> on the ground.</p> 
                    <p>Below you to the east, a Greater Tree Shaman will be roaming around with regular Tree Shaman enemies praying in different corners of the courtyard. The Greater Shaman will drop a Revered Spirit Ash on defeat. In the corner where shamans are praying, you will find up x4 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Budding Horn" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Budding+Horn" target="">Budding Horn</a>. On the east side of the courtyard, you can pick up x2 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Lightningproof Pickled Liver" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Lightningproof+Pickled+Liver" target="">Lightningproof Pickled Liver</a> from a corpse.</p> 
                    <p>Head down the stairs beside the body to reach the base of a tree with two hostile Humanoid Flies. Once you have killed the two enemies, you can pick up x8 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Thin Beast Bones" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Thin+Beast+Bones" target="">Thin Beast Bones</a> from the corpse nearby. Northeast of the tree roots is a body that you can loot for x3 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Whiteflesh Mushroom" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Whiteflesh+Mushroom" target="">Whiteflesh Mushroom</a> along with two more Humanoid Flies that will try to land on you.</p> 
                    <p>Traverse through the path on the west side of the giant tree roots. Be careful here, as a Humanoid Fly will be hiding to your right, waiting to attack you. You can also find x4 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Redflesh Mushroom" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Redflesh+Mushroom" target="">Redflesh Mushroom</a> on top of a root nearby. Straight ahead will be three Humanoid Flies praying. After clearing the enemies, you can pick up x2 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Revered Spirit Ash" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Revered+Spirit+Ash" target="">Revered Spirit Ash</a> lying nearby. Return to the courtyard to head deeper into Enir-Ilim.</p> 
                    <p>Once you have found yourself back in the courtyard, head up the stairs to the southeast. You will encounter a Tree Shaman on top of the stairs. After killing the Tree Shaman, continue following the path until you encounter a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Horned Warrior" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Horned+Warrior" target="">Horned Warrior</a>.</p> 
                    <p>After dealing with the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Horned Warrior" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Horned+Warrior" target="">Horned Warrior</a>, you will see a platform to your north with a tree shaman and an item. You can use the tree branches to your east to reach the platform. Immediately after dropping down, you can loot x3 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Furlcalling Finger Remedy" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Furlcalling+Finger+Remedy" target="">Furlcalling Finger Remedy</a> behind you. Cross the branches to the platform and deal with the tree shaman. You can pick up the incantation <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Spira" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Spira" target="">Spira</a> on the altar and drop to the courtyard below. Return to where you fought the Horned Warrior and continue from there.</p> 
                    <p>Follow the path and take the stairs leading up. You can pick up x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Dragonbolt Grease" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dragonbolt+Grease" target="">Dragonbolt Grease</a> on the ground, but there will be a magic attack that seems to be coming from above. Sprint up the stairs, then kill Tree Mage responsible for the flurry of magic attacks. On the platform to the left, you will find x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Drawstring Golden Grease" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Drawstring+Golden+Grease" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Drawstring Golden Grease</a>.</p> 
                    <p>Up the stairs, a Tree Shaman will be patrolling the area. You will also notice another Tree Mage on the rooftop of the structure in front of you which you can deal with by using ranged attacks or by sprinting past its spell attacks. After clearing the two enemies, head up the stairs. You can loot two corpses for x10 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Fire Arrow" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fire+Arrow" target="">Fire Arrow</a> and x10 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Golden Bolt" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Bolt" target="">Golden Bolt</a> along the way.</p> 
                    <p>Open the door at the top of the stairs to discover the Spiral Rise Site of Grace [<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Interactive Map?id=655275&amp;code=mapD" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=655275&amp;code=mapD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See Elden Ring Map</a>] and x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Scadutree Fragment" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scadutree+Fragment" target="">Scadutree Fragment</a>.</p> 
                    <p>The area just before the Spiral Rise Site of Grace [<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Interactive Map?id=655275&amp;code=mapD" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=655275&amp;code=mapD">See Elden Ring Map</a>] has a lot of loot that you shouldn't miss. From the Site of Grace, backtrack your way down the stairs, then turn left to find a set of steps going down.

Look down on the southeastern section of the ledge, and you will find another area that you can drop down to.</p> 
                    <p>Drop down to it, then follow the ledge going south. You'll come across a broken section going to an item. Jump to get to the other side, and you can pick up x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Holyproof Pickled Liver" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Holyproof+Pickled+Liver" target="">Holyproof Pickled Liver</a>.

                    <p>Follow the ledge going south. Be careful as there are pillars blocking off some parts of the ledge, making it tough to navigate. Keep hugging the wall just to be safe. When you go around the corner, you will find another area that you can jump down to. Jump down the area, then traverse the ledge going southwest.  </p> 
                    <p>Keep following it, and you will acquire x10 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Lordsworn's Bolt" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Lordsworn's+Bolt" target="">Lordsworn's Bolt</a> from a dead body at the end of it.

                    <p>To progress further, sprint jump down the window south of the dead body containing x10 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Golem's Great Arrow" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golem's+Great+Arrow" target="">Golem's Great Arrow</a>.</p> 
                    <p>Once you have successfully jumped on the window, head inside the structure. The section you are in will be inside Belurat, Tower Settlement. Head out of the room, and you will end up in a courtyard. Pick up the x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Scadutree Fragment" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scadutree+Fragment" target="">Scadutree Fragment</a> by the covered statue. There are two other rooms that you can enter from the courtyard. The room on the east has a lift that you can take to return to Enir-Ilim, while the room on the south has a lift going down Belurat, Tower Settlement. Ride down the lift in the southern room.  </p> 
                    <p>After taking the lift, head outside by going through the archway on the southeastern side of the room. Follow the path by going down a staircase which leads you to a room containing three Tree Shamans. After clearing the room, follow the path going southwest. Head down the stairs, and you'll encounter a Horned Warrior patrolling the area. You can either fight it head-on, or you can sneak around as the Horned Warrior is patrolling in a way that you can sneak around it. </p> 
                    <p>After dealing with the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Horned Warrior" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Horned+Warrior" target="">Horned Warrior</a> with whichever method you choose, head inside the structure then go down the stairs on the western side. Go down the lift, and you will arrive in the area with a bridge crossing to a door. Cross the bridge, then open the door. You'll find a dead body by the altar, which you can loot for the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Euporia" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Euporia" target="">Euporia</a> twinblade.</p> 
                    <p>Return to Spiral Rise - Site of Grace, then head north of the room to climb up the stairs. There will be an opening on the left side of the stairs which lets you attack the Tree Mage earlier on the rooftop if you didn't get the chance to kill it. If you go back to the staircase, it will lead to a dead-end, so your only choice would be to traverse through the rooftop. Keep following the rooftop path by turning right as you exit through the opening. You'll encounter hostile large birds around the rooftop area, which you can easily dispose of. One of the birds will be hiding behind a corner, so be cautious of it. You can find x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Smithing Stone [8]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+[8]" target="">Smithing Stone [8]</a> atop the roof near the part where the bird was hiding.</p> 
                    <p>Keep going west until you get into an opening of a walkway. There will be another large bird guarding a room and a tree shaman patrolling the stairs. You can sneak up on the bird to easily dispose of it. Enter the room that the large bird was blocking to pick up x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Revered Spirit Ash" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Revered+Spirit+Ash" target="">Revered Spirit Ash</a>. Continue heading up, and if you didn't deal with the Tree Shaman earlier, it will be in this room along with another Tree Shaman. Deal with the shamans, then continue through the archway on the western side of the room and keep climbing the stairs.</p> 
                    <p>As you get to the top of the stairs, you will find a room that contains x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Scadutree Fragment" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scadutree+Fragment" target="">Scadutree Fragment</a> lying on an altar. Keep exploring the rooftops, in which you will encounter a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Horned Warrior" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Horned+Warrior" target="">Horned Warrior</a>. You can sneak up on it and try to do a backstab to make the fight easier. It will use frost magic along with the greatsword they are wielding, so be cautious of those attacks. On the northeast side of the rooftop, you can loot a body to pickup x2 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Sunwarmth Stone" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Sunwarmth+Stone" target="">Sunwarmth Stone</a>.</p> 
                    <p>If you want to find more loot, go back to where you picked up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Revered Spirit Ash" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Revered+Spirit+Ash" target="">Revered Spirit Ash</a>. In the middle of the stairs going up, you can drop down to a set of stairs. You can find x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Silver Horn Tender" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Silver+Horn+Tender" target="">Silver Horn Tender</a> on the edge of the staircase going down.

Climb up another ladder to get to the top floor of the structure, then jump off of it back into the rooftop where you fought a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Horned Warrior" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Horned+Warrior" target="">Horned Warrior</a> using ice spells. </p> 
                    <p>Keep going by jumping up on the rooftop, and you'll find your way back to the structure of the First Rise Site of Grace, bypassing the destroyed part of the staircase. If you head down the staircase, you will find x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Somber Smithing Stone [6]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone+[6]" target="">Somber Smithing Stone [6]</a> lying on the ground near the part where the staircase cuts off. If you look down the destroyed part of the stairs, you will see a platform containing an item. You can go there by jumping off the stairs. You will get to pick up x1 <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Gravebird Helm" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Gravebird+Helm" target="">Gravebird Helm</a> if you choose to go to the platform.</p> 
                    <p>After looting the platform, you can jump on a staircase on the east side of the platform. Head down the stairs, and you will find an area with a lever that when pulled down, will bring a lift to where you currently are. There will also be a doorway leading down to an empty room with a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Curseblade" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Curseblade" target="">Curseblade</a> hiding out of sight by the other doorway. Defeat the Curseblade, then proceed down the broken staircase when you go through the archway leading outside.

                    <p>Make your way back to where you pulled the lever then ride the lift going up. You will end up in a room with two Tree Shamans that you can easily dispose of. After clearing the room, head to the archway on the south of the room leading to a stairway going up. You will encounter a <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Horned Warrior" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Horned+Warrior" target="">Horned Warrior</a> patrolling near the area, which is different from the one you encountered earlier. It uses wind attacks to complement its greatsword, and it can also swing its greatsword successively. Wait for your turn to attack it.

Defeating this boss will open the gate to the next region, <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Scadu Altus" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scadu+Altus" target="">Scadu Altus</a>. Before leaving the castle, through the archway on the northern side of the room. Follow the path but traverse it near the cliffside on the left. Drop down the cliff, then follow the stream going back to Castle Ensis. You will eventually arrive at a rampart in Castle Ensis in which you will find a chest. Open the chest, and you will receive the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Carian Sorcery Sword" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Carian+Sorcery+Sword" target="">Carian Sorcery Sword</a>.</p>

                </ul> 
                <p>Exit through the newly opened gate after defeating Rellana in Castle Ensis. Travel north by following the main path and you will come across <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Needle Knight Leda" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Needle+Knight+Leda" target="">Needle Knight Leda</a> and <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Hornsent" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Hornsent" target="">Hornsent</a> at the Highroad Cross - Site of Grace. Make sure to pick up the Monk's Missive and the gesture in this location. After this meeting, head north to pick up the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Map: Scadu Altus" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Map:+Scadu+Altus" target="">Map: Scadu Altus</a>, then head west to the Church of the Crusade and fight <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Fire Knight Queelign (NPC)" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fire+Knight+Queelign+(NPC)" target="">Fire Knight Queelign (NPC)</a> there. If you went to Belurat Tower Settlement and fought him there, you could pick up an <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ash of War: Flame Skewer" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ash+of+War:+Flame+Skewer" target="">Ash of War: Flame Skewer</a> from him. This only drops during the second encounter, and you can still get it later on at Shadow Keep.</p> 
                <p>After this, head south and explore <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Moorth Ruins" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Moorth+Ruins" target="">Moorth Ruins</a> which contains a tunnel access to <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Bonny Village" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bonny+Village" target="">Bonny Village</a>. You could also head north from Moorth Ruins to reach Rauh Base, but since there are no NPC interactions there, we can skip the entire location. For now, you will explore the area underneath Moorth Ruins and locate the tunnel connecting it to <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Bonny Village" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bonny+Village" target="">Bonny Village</a>.</p> 
                <p>Once you reach the Site of Grace in Bonny Village, use it and look for the O Mother (<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Gestures" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Gestures" target="">Gesture</a>) [<a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Interactive Map?id=655089&amp;code=mapD" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=655089&amp;code=mapD">See it on the map here</a>]. This is an important item that you will need later on to progress questlines. To continue your exploration, cross the bridge to the eastern side and head to the Cathedral of Manus Metyr.</p> 
                <p>As you head north following the path here, you will receive a notification saying that a great rune has been broken, and a charm as well (This event opens up the path to <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring St. Trina" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/St.+Trina" target="">St. Trina</a> and you can now head to Cerulean Coast in Southern Shore to progress her questline after Scadu Altus. This event also marks changes with NPCs and it is recommended to travel to their respective Site of Graces to talk to them.</p> 
                <p>Continue traveling north until you reach the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Cathedral of Manus Metyr" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Cathedral+of+Manus+Metyr" target="">Cathedral of Manus Metyr</a>, go inside and speak with <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Count Ymir" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Count+Ymir" target="">Count Ymir</a> and <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Jolan" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Jolan" target="">Jolan</a>. Exhaust all their dialogues to initiate their quests. When you're done, you will now head to Shadow Keep - Church District. The reason that we're skipping Rauh Base in the summarized version is because there are no NPC interactions there, and is a location that doesn't play a role in NPC progression. You can still explore Rauh Base if you wish before entering Shadow Keep. </p> 
                <h3 class="special">Shadow Keep - Church District</h3> 
                <ul> 
                    <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>NOTE</strong></span>: Speak with all NPCs before entering Shadow Keep, especially after you get the loud notification that a great rune has been broken.</li> 
                    <li>The Church District is a location that's inaccessible from the Main Gate because this area is flooded and you need to drain the water first.</li> 
                    <li>Use the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Prayer Room Key" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Prayer+Room+Key" target="">Prayer Room Key</a> (from Church of the Crusade) and speak with Fire Knight Queelign (decide if you want to give <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Iris of Grace" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Iris+of+Grace" target="">Iris of Grace</a> or <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Iris of Occultation" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Iris+of+Occultation" target="">Iris of Occultation</a>)</li>

                </ul> 
                <p>Your goal in this location is to fully explore the back section of Shadow Keep, drain the water to access the lower area, and an optional fight against the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Scadutree Avatar" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scadutree+Avatar" target="">Scadutree Avatar</a>. You can skip it too if you like, but you can earn good rewards from defeating it, like its remembrance. The important NPC interaction here is to find Fire Knight Queelign's room and use the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Prayer Room Key" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Prayer+Room+Key" target="">Prayer Room Key</a> that you obtained at the Church of the Crusade and use it here. Inside this room, you will decide if you want to get his greatsword or his spirit ashes which you will do by giving him either an <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Iris of Grace" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Iris+of+Grace" target="">Iris of Grace</a> or <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Iris of Occultation" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Iris+of+Occultation" target="">Iris of Occultation</a>.</p> 
                <p>After this interaction, you need to look for the way to Shadow Keep, Back Gate, and use the site of grace so you can come back here later to explore Scaduview and Hinterlands. For now, you will return to Castle Front - Site of Grace (outside Castle Ensis to progress Thiollier and St. Trina's questlines). You will do this by navigating the path to St. Trina, and at this point, you have broken Miquella's Charm and revealed the access to <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Stone Coffin Fissure" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Stone+Coffin+Fissure" target="">Stone Coffin Fissure</a> where you will meet St. Trina later on.</p>

                <p>To progress Thiollier's questline, return to his location at the Pillar Path Cross - Site of Grace and let him know of your discovery about St. Trina's location. This will prompt him to move if you rest at a grace, so if you're trying to get the incantation and the spirit ashes from the dragon priestess, make sure to exchange the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Thiollier's Concoction" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Thiollier's+Concoction" target="">Thiollier's Concoction</a> now.

                    <li>Defeat Messmer the Impaler (skips <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Eastern Nameless Mausoleum" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Eastern+Nameless+Mausoleum" target="">Eastern Nameless Mausoleum</a>, Dark Rift Catacombs, and <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Abyssal Woods" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Abyssal+Woods" target="">Abyssal Woods</a>)</li> 
                    <li>Choose to summon Hornsent during the Messmer fight or not</li> 
                    <li>Return to Hornsent Grandam to receive final item from her.</li> 
                </ul> 
                <p>Go through the Main Gate and ride the elevator going up. Enter the plaza and defeat the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Golden Hippopotamus" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Hippopotamus" target="">Golden Hippopotamus</a> here. Your exploration will begin by locating the shortcut access around the area, and back to the Main Plaza. After that, you will take part in the Hornsent and Leda fight. Then, look for the West Rampart - Site of Grace, which you will use later.</p> 
                <p>Another NPC progression here is locating Sir Ansbach at the Storehouse, First Floor and Redmane Freyja at the Seventh Floor. You can visit their pages for the full details but the important thing to remember here is to make sure that you get the Letter for Freyja first before you give the Secret Rite Scroll to Sir Ansbach. If you happen to give him the scroll and leave his area without getting the letter, he will leave the area, and stall Freyja's questline and prevent you from taking all of her items.</p> 
                <p>Make sure that you deliver the Letter for Freyja so you can receive the Golden Lion Shield. This action will also prompt her to show up in the fight later in Enir-Ilim so you can take her armor and weapon. When you're done with important NPC quests, you will now fight Messmer the Impaler, this is the legacy dungeon boss and you can summon <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Hornsent" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Hornsent" target="">Hornsent</a> during this fight to progress his questline. This also prompts him to show up again in <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ancient Ruins of Rauh" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ancient+Ruins+of+Rauh" target="">Ancient Ruins of Rauh</a> so you can get the rest of his items earlier. Not summoning him in Messmer fight will prompt him to take revenge against you and will show up as an ally to Needle Knight Leda later.</p> 
                <h3 class="special">Ancient Ruins of Rauh</h3> 
                <ul> 
                    <li>Fight the NPC invader</li> 
                    <li>Fight <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Romina, Saint of the Bud" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Romina,+Saint+of+the+Bud" target="">Romina, Saint of the Bud</a></li> 
                </ul> 
                <p>Cross the bridge past West Rampart - Site of Grace to formally enter <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Ancient Ruins of Rauh" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ancient+Ruins+of+Rauh" target="">Ancient Ruins of Rauh</a>, where your goal is to eliminate <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Romina, Saint of the Bud" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Romina,+Saint+of+the+Bud" target="">Romina, Saint of the Bud</a>. Right before you come up the steps to her location, you will get invaded by <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Hornsent" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Hornsent">this NPC</a> if you progressed their questline, allowing you to get their items earlier. Defeat Romina in her arena and her death will reveal a Sealing Tree that blocks the way to the final legacy dungeon.</p> 
                <p>When you get there, you can use <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Messmer's Kindling" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Messmer's+Kindling" target="">Messmer's Kindling</a> to burn it and trigger a cutscene that shows the true form of <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Enir-Ilim" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Enir-Ilim" target="">Enir-Ilim</a>. (The kindling is an item that you can get from defeating Messmer the Impaler in <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Shadow Keep" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+Keep" target="">Shadow Keep</a>.)</p> 
                <h3 class="special">Enir-Ilim</h3> 
                <ul> 
                    <li>Defeat Needle Knight Leda and her allies</li> 
                    <li>Defeat the final boss</li> 
                </ul> 
                <p><span style="color: #ffcc00;">BONUS</span>: The <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Euporia" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Euporia" target="">Euporia</a> is a brand new Twinblade that can be obtained by accessing a secret room before the Spiral Rise - Site of Grace. You can read the guide on <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Euporia" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Euporia">this page</a> to learn the full details (the guide is long but the weapon is totally worth it!)</p> 
                <p>Once you reach a certain area here, you will be fighting the followers of Miquella the Kind. Different hostile NPCs will get in your way. The enemies who will show up here will largely depend on the choices you have made so far. After eliminating them, you will head up to fight the last boss. Continue to go to the top of the dungeon where you will meet a familiar boss, the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Promised Consort Radahn" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Promised+Consort+Radahn" target="">Promised Consort Radahn</a> and <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring Miquella" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Miquella" target="">Miquella</a> will also appear here.</p> 
                <p>If you progressed Thiollier's questline, he can be summoned to fight the final boss, and then you can pick up his items within the arena after the fight. Then, travel to the Garden of Deep Purple and take the <a class="wiki_link" title="Elden Ring St. Trina's Blossom" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/St.+Trina's+Blossom" target="">St. Trina's Blossom</a> from her last position.</p>
